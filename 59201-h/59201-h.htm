<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>“M</span></span>EN——” Taisie meant to say “Good morning,
men,” as usually she did if she came to
the cook house door before they had finished
breakfast. But this morning she hesitated, halted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There had been the usual mealtime silence of the
cattle hands, broken only by rasp or chatter of steel on
tin; but as the tall girl’s shadow fell at the door of the
log house Jim Nabours, foreman of Del Sol, rose at his
place. Fifteen other men pushed back their chairs
nervously, staring at the boss as though caught in some
overt criminal act. In the occupation of eating a regulation
breakfast of beef and beans, cattle hands, time
out of mind, have asked no aid and invited no company.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Taisie Lockhart was their hereditary chieftainess.
Her father, Colonel Burleson Lockhart, these two
years deceased—a strong man in his day, and a poignant—had
owned the Laguna del Sol range, of unknown
acreage. Likewise, he had owned no man knew how
many thousand head of long-horned cattle, from calves
to mossy horns; owned yonder branching and rambling
building of log and adobe called the big house; owned
the round pens and the live-oak groves, the mast-fed
range hogs and the nuts that fed them; owned bunk
houses and cook house and corrals. Yes, and owned
faith of body and soul of every man that lived on Del
Sol, from old Salazar to the gawkiest ranch boy to put
his saddle under the shed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Heiress to all this, as her father had owned lands
and herds and men, so did Taisie Lockhart. But to
her, orphaned and alone, came an added fealty from her
men that amounted almost to fanaticism. Most of them
had known and loved her from her childhood. In her
young womanhood they enshrined her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boss of Laguna del Sol now stood framed in
the doorway, in man’s garb of shirt and trousers—an
assumption shocking in that land and day. This costume
she deliberately had assumed when she took on a
man’s duties in a business preëminently masculine.
Obviously now, she was tall, slender, supple, rounded
to a full physical inheritance of womanly charm unhardened
by years of life in the saddle and under the
sun. More; she was an actual beauty. Anywhere else
she would have been a sensation. Here, she spoiled
each unfinished breakfast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Against the morning light the freckles of Anastasie
Lockhart could not be seen. No matter. Every man
of these could have told you the number and contour of
them each and all. In a way, too, they could have told
you that her freckles went with her hair. The light
that shone through the mass of dark red hair—long and
unconfined she wore it, clubbed between her shoulders
with a shoestring—lighted a thousand fronds into a
sort of aureole, halo, crown. Not that this, either, was
needed. For long, Taisie Lockhart, orphan owner of
Laguna del Sol—just south of Stephen Austin’s first
settlement in old Texas it lay—had been traditional
saint, angel, to every creature that bore boots and spurs
within a hundred miles. Nay, more than that; across
two states—old Texas and old Louisiana—so far as
interchange of information then went, before the day
of telegraph and rails, men, and even women, spoke in
hushed tones of Taisie Lockhart; the former out of
awe at her beauty, the latter out of pity for her fate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An orphan, left alone at twenty, just as she came
home from her convent schooling at the ancient city of
New Orleans, with no woman relative and no female
companions other than her servants, what could be the
fate of such a girl, seventy-five miles from the nearest
town, twenty-five from the nearest rancho, and the
rumor of her beauty continually spreading league by
league? On her shoulders rested all the responsibilities
of what was or had been one of the largest and richest
ranches of Central Texas, and thereto was the responsibility
for what manner of beauty sets mad the hearts
of men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every woman in all Texas, at least in all the Texas
of Bexar, Guadalupe, Comal, Gonzales and Caldwell
counties, was sorry for Taisie Lockhart. She was trying
to hold together the property left her by the sudden
death—through murder—of her father, Burleson
Lockhart, frontiersman on the bloody borders of the
Southwest since 1831. And every woman wondered
what man she would marry. Every woman also
demanded that she marry soon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An Alabama man Burleson Lockhart’s father had
been; he himself was Louisianian up to his young manhood;
and since then Texan, from a time before the
Texas Republic was born. Add to Burleson Lockhart’s
six feet of fighting manhood the tender beauty of
Anastasie Brousseau, gentle and beautiful Louisiana
girl, willing to leave her own plantation home among
the moss-hung bayou lands for the red borders of
Comanche land—and behold Taisie, present mistress
of Del Sol, motherless since six, educated by her father
in compliance with her mother’s steady wish, and now
owner of a vast property that to-day would mean many
millions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But to-day in Texas is not the day of 1867. Yonder
was a country wild, almost lawless, unfettered, savage;
moreover just then roughened and wholly disheartened
by the Civil War. In truth, taking her as she stood,
within half a foot of six feet, beautiful despite her
boots and trousers, Taisie Lockhart was no more than
a dead-broke heiress to a potential but wholly dormant
wealth, or to possessions which but now had vanished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And that was why she now broke down in her morning
salutation, even when all her men arose and joined
Jim Nabours in silent attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Men——” began the tall girl once more, and once
more failed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Taisie Lockhart ignominiously leaned her red
head on her brown hand against the gray cook house
door jamb and shed genuine feminine tears. Which
act made every man present wish that he could do
violence to something or somebody.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boss was crying! Well, why? Had anything—had
anybody——The eye of each looked to his wall
nail, where, in ranch etiquette, he had hung his gun
before taking up his knife and fork.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim Nabours cleared his throat. His Adam’s apple
struggled convulsively, walking up and down his brown
and sinewy neck. Taisie knew he wanted to speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Men,” she began yet again, at last desperately facing
them with undried eyes, and stepping fully into the
long room, “I’ve come to say good-by to you. I’ve—we’ve—you’ve
got to go!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men stood, shocked. What could she mean?
Go? Where? What? Quit the brand? Leave Laguna
del Sol? Leave her, the boss? What did that mean?
Not even Jim Nabours could break the horrified silence,
and he had been foreman these five and twenty years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Boys,” said Taisie Lockhart at last, suddenly
spreading out her hands, “I’m done! I’m broke! I—I
can’t pay you any more!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then Taisie Lockhart, owner of perhaps fifty
thousand acres of land and what had once been
fifty thousand cows, broke down absolutely. She cast
herself on the board bench at one side of the clothless
table, sunk her glorious head on her flung arms and
wept; wept like a child in need of comfort. And there
was none in all the world to comfort her, unless sixteen
lean and gawky cow hands could do so; which, now
patently, they could not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Taisie, what you mean?” began Jim Nabours,
after a very long time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Broke!” whispered Anastasie Lockhart collegiately.
“Broke at last! Boys, I’m clean busted and for fair!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That ain’t no ways what I mean, Miss Taisie!” went
on the anguished foreman. “Broke ain’t nothing. Yore
paw was broke; everybody in all Texas is and always
has been. Pay? He didn’t; nobody does. But what
I—now, what I mean is, what do you mean when you
say we got to go? What have we done? What you got
against us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing, Jim.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, good Lord! There ain’t a man here that
wouldn’t—that wouldn’t—indeed, ma’am, there ain’t,
not one of us that wouldn’t—So now then, you say
we got to go? Why? You’d ought to tell us why,
anyways, ma’am. That’s only fair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl’s somber eyes looked full into his as she
raised her head, one clenched hand still on the table top,
the quirt loop still around the wrist. She faced business
disaster with the courage many a business man has
lacked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what makes me cry,” said she simply. “It’s
because you won’t go easy when I tell you. It’s because
you’ll be wanting to keep on working for me for nothing.
I can’t stand that. If I can hire you I’ve got to
pay you. When I can’t, I’m done. Well, I can’t any
more. I’d sell my piano for this month’s pay. I’ve
tried to, but I can’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What? You’d sell the Del Sol pianny? Why, Miss
Taisie, what you mean? I helped freight her up here
from Galveston. That’s the onliest pianny in Middle
Texas, far’s I know. That’s branded T. L., that pianny!
And you’d sell her to pay a lot of measly cow hands
wages they didn’t no ways ever half earn? Why,
ma’am!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again sundry evolutions of the Adam’s apple of Mr.
Nabours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t doubt you’d stay on, because you’ve all
worked around here so long. You’d all be careless
about your wages; you’d do anything for me, yes.
That’s because you think I’m a girl. You think you
have to. I’m not—you don’t. I’m a business man, like
any one else. If I can’t make Del Sol pay I’ve got to
give it up; that’s all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m four months behind now,” she added, “and not
one of you has whimpered. The store’s naked and you
know it. Some of you even may be out of tobacco, but
you don’t complain. That’s what cuts me. You’re the
finest bunch of hands that ever crossed leather, and I
can’t pay you. All right! If I can’t, you can’t work
for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Miss Taisie, ma’am,” struggled her foreman,
“ ’tain’t nothing a-tall. What’s a few pesos one way or
other? We can’t buy nothing, nohow, even if we had
money, and don’t want to, noways.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Besides, what’d become of us? Besides, what’d become
of you? Have you ever thought of that? Didn’t
I promise yore paw, and yore maw, too, that I’d look
after you and yore interests long as we was both alive?
Well, then?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ain’t got much savvy outside of cows, ma’am,” he
went on; “but cows I do know well as the next. It’s all
cows, this part of Texas, and we all know it. There
ain’t no market and never will be. We can’t sell cows
at six bits a head, or a hide, neither, and we all know
that—everybody’s got cows that ain’t worth a damn,
ma’am, of course. But what I mean is, if the T. L.
can’t make a living there ain’t no ranch in Texas can.
I don’t put my hands back of no outfit in the world,
ma’am. We’ve run the T. L. on over twelve hundred
head of loose stuff this winter, and I told the boys to
pick the yearlings and twos careful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes shifted, he perspired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We got plenty of water and all outdoors. We didn’t
lose one per cent last summer, and winters was when
we didn’t lose nothing. The increase is a crime, ma’am.
If we’d hold a rodeo in our band—which we’d ought
to—God knows how many we’d find in the T. L. I’d
bet sixty-five thousand! And the mesquite full of long
ears that no man claims. If we can’t do well no stockman
in Texas can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes avoided hers as he gave these Homerically
mendacious figures. But he went on stoutly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet you talk of quitting! Why should you? The
old Laguna is the richest range in Texas. Our grass
sets ’em out a hundred and fifty a head heavier than
them damned coasters from below, ma’am.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if you talk of turning off us men, where’d we
go? What’d we do? I ask you that, anyways, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If there was any market,” began Taisie, “it would
be different. As it is, the more we brand the poorer
we get.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, all right; we ain’t any poorer than our neighbors.
Market? Of course there ain’t no market!
Rockport has failed—canning cows don’t pay. Hides
is low. There’s nothing in the steamship trade, and no
use driving East since the war is over. Besides, with
such good water and range as we got on Del Sol, why,
nothing ever dies; so there ain’t no hides no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As for long ears, slicks, we’re as good off as old Sam
Maverick, that wouldn’t never bother to brand nothing
hardly, and so found hisself swamped when the war was
over. We got less unworked long-ear range west of us
than anybody, but nobody tries to sell hides or cows
now. The New Orleans market costs more to get a cow
to than the cow comes to when he’s there. The steamships
has us choked off of everything east of us; we
can’t ship nothing and break even on it. Every one of
us knows that, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too many cows!” Taisie’s head shook from side
to side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes! Enduring the war, cows just growed like flies
in here and all over Texas. Market? No, that’s so.
But when you once get to raising cows, ma’am, and
branding cows that no one else has raised, and seeing
the herds roll up and roll up—why, it’s no use! No
cattleman can do no different. If we had a market—why,
yes. We hain’t, and ain’t going to have; but
what’s the use crying over that? Shall every stockman
in Texas lay down and quit cows just because he can’t
sell cows and ain’t got no market? If he does the state
might as well quit being a state. It might as well, anyhow,
since the damn Yankees taken it over to run since
the war.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shadow of Reconstruction was on Jim Nabours’
face. And what he said covered the whole story of the
general destitution of an unmeasured empire tenanted
by uncounted millions of Nature’s tribute to life when
left alone. This was Texas after the Civil War, impoverished
amid such bounty of wild Nature as no other
part of this great republic ever has known. The first
Saxon owner of Laguna del Sol paid for some of it in
Texas land scrip that had not cost him two and a half
cents an acre. His original land grant had cost him
less. Scrip went in blocks and bales, held worthless.
Men laughed at those who owned it. Land? It could
never fail. The world was wide; the sun was kind;
life was an easy, indolent, certain thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing less than a section of land was covered by
scrip. It was nothing to own a thousand sections, if one
liked to fad it. And, since a hundred thousand cattle
might roam there unmolested and uncounted, it literally
was true that every man in Texas was land poor and
cow poor—if he was so ignorant and foolish as to buy
land scrip at two to five cents an acre when he might
have all the range he liked for nothing at all, and all
the cows he cared for without the bother of counting
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was genesis. It was still in the beginning, in the
Texas of 1867, where the Americans had just begun to
extend the thin antennæ of the Saxon civilization. Here
was a life for a bold man, rude, careless, free, independent
of law and government. A world unbounded,
inestimable, lay in the making.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But any who could have read fully this little drama
at the cook house would have known that world to be
tenanted by folk embittered by the war and ready to say
that their world now was made and done. Of these,
Taisie Lockhart, orphan loaded with riches that could
not be rendered portable or divisible, made one more
unhappy unit. She was, naturally, far the more unhappy
because through her education she had found a
wider outlook on life and the world than had these
others. Somewhere, too, in her stern ancestry had been
a sense of personal honor which left her still more
sensitive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the immortal gods take pity on the sorrows of
youth and beauty, it may chance. They have their own
ways, employ agents of their own selecting. This
orphan heiress, keen to pay her debts, became one of
the first factors in one of the most Homeric epochs
in the history of all the world. Not so long after this
woebegone meeting of bankrupt cattle folk at the Del
Sol cook house there was to appear a phenomenon that
set at naught all customs, that asked no precedent, that
defied even the ancient laws of section and of latitude.
All of which did not just now develop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Set down, Miss Taisie,” said the gray old foreman,
awkwardly, gently, flushing at asking the owner of Del
Sol to be seated in her own cook house. She had arisen,
and, hands at her eyes, was about to leave the place.
Now she dropped back and looked at him dumbly,
suddenly no more than a weak girl at her wits’ end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now listen to me, Miss Taisie,” began old Jim
Nabours with sudden firmness. “You know I’ve
worked for yore folks all my life, ever since I come
down from the Brazos forty years ago. I come back
here when the war stopped—Kirby Smith’s men on the
Lower Red was the last to surrender. This is my place,
that’s all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, I got a right to talk plain to you. I’m a-going
to. When you say you’re going to turn off a bunch of
the best cow hands in Texas, just because you can’t pay
their wages no more, why, then you ain’t showing
reason ner judgment I’m foreman for the T. L. brand.
What I say goes. When you say we’re turned loose
you’re talking foolish. We ain’t! What’s wages to
us? I’d like for you to tell me. Did we get any in the
Army? Does anybody pay wages now, in all Texas?
How can they?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Taisie, I went with yore paw to Austin, when
he was a member, and in the big Assembly Room was a
man at a desk with a hammer, and says he, ever oncet
in a while, ‘Motion done overruled!’ Then he soaks the
table with the hammer. And now, ma’am, yore motion
about firing sixteen good cow hands is done overruled!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim Nabours’ great fist fell with the force of a gavel
on the breakfast table, till the tin plates rattled under
their two-tined forks and the nicked cups brought added
antiphony. Frowning, he looked savagely at the young
woman. He was no better than her peon for life, for
her father had given her to his care. She was the very
apple of his eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what are we going to do, Jim?” Taisie’s tears
now were less open and unashamed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What makes you ask that of me, ma’am? I ain’t
got that fur along yet. I don’t know what we’re going
to do. But I do know, for first, we ain’t going to quit.
Fire us? Why, good God!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The grizzled beard of Jim Nabours to some extent
concealed the Adam’s apple, now again on its travels.
There was not a man in the embarrassed group who did
not wish himself in the chaparral precisely then, but
every man of them nodded in assent. Of them all only
old Sanchez, thin, brown and wrinkled, spoke at first—an
old, old Mexican, born on Del Sol under its second
transfer from the crown of Spain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Si, señorita</span>,” said he. “<span class='it'>Es verdad!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shore it’s the truth!” broke out a freckled youth of
seventeen, the soft beard just showing on his cheeks.
But then, as he later confessed, he plumb bogged down.
And the youngest of them all—Cinquo Centavas, they
called him, since he had but five copper pennies when
he rode in, twelve years of age; he was now fourteen—stood
with his blue eyes wet with tears, unashamed in
his rags.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me time to think, men!” said Anastasie Lockhart,
immeasurably touched by all this. “Let me see.
Wait—I don’t know!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rose and went to the door, framed once more
gloriously against the sun; and sixteen pairs of eyes of
silent men went with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sudden baying of the ranch pack of foxhounds
arose. It was not directed toward her. The dogs were
streaming toward the pole gate of the yard fence. A
rider was coming in.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span><h1>CHAPTER II<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A NEW WORLD</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>I</span></span>T WAS not the custom of the young mistress of
Del Sol to ride out to meet strangers at her gate.
She received callers in her own rude office or her
almost ruder parlor. To meet any caller on this morning
was distasteful to her every thought. She gave the
incomer only a glance as she walked to her horse, which
stood, head drooping, anchored by the long bridle reins
thrown down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A peculiar animal, Taisie’s favorite mount, so marked
as to be distinguished anywhere. No doubt descended
from Blanco, the great white wild horse whose menada
ran on the Double Mountain Fork of the Brazos, Blancocito’s
dam must have been a buckskin, for he himself
was a dark claybank, with the coveted black stripe along
his back. But Blanco—said by some range men to be
not many removes from Arabian, though of unknown
origin—had given his son a white face, four white
stockings and a singular harnesslike stripe of clean
white, four inches wide, across both hips, running down
almost to the white stockings of the hind legs. He
could be told a mile away. It would have been of no
use to steal him, and his shoulder brand was but perfunctory.
Jim Nabours and most of the hands scoffed
at any pinto, and selected solid colors—any color so only
it was not black; but Blancocito put all their horsely
wisdom to shame. He never tired and never quit. No
trail was too long for him. Gentled when a three, he
never wholly had surrendered even to Taisie or the best
of Taisie’s top riders his inalienable Texas right to life,
liberty and the pursuit of pitching, though these tendencies
he usually held in abeyance in the case of his
mistress. When he liked, he could be “mean to set,”
according to some others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just now Blancocito bit at the arm of his rider as she
flung the reins over his neck and facing back, got foot
in the stirrup and right hand on the horn of the cow
saddle, true vaquero fashion. As she swung up to the
seat his forefeet left the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quit it!” said Taisie to him, and slapped his neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Blancocito bit at the tapaderos—gently, for he
meant no harm; pitched just a little, with no malice
in his heart; and so settled down to the springiest jog
trot of any and all the horses in the T. L. brand; a gait
which he could keep all day, and did keep now for two
or three hundred yards, till his rider swung out of
saddle at her own door and threw down the reins again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Distrait as she was, Taisie Lockhart had not failed
to note from the corner of an eye the young man who
had entered the gate. He had hesitated an instant before
choosing the cook house as his objective. She let him
take the cook house, though with a swift doubt that he
would stay there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A tall man he was, perhaps twenty-five, perhaps
thirty; slender, brown, with dark hair a trifle long, as
so many men of that land then wore their hair. His
face, contrary to the custom of the country, was smooth
shaven, save for a narrow dark mustache. His eyes,
could Taisie have seen them, were blue-gray, singularly
keen and straight, his mouth keen and straight, unsmiling.
He left the impression of a nature hard, cold;
or at least much self-contained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These last details the mistress of Del Sol could not
at the time note, but she was schooled to catch the brand
of his horse, the fashion of his equipment. His saddle
was deeply embossed, not lacking silver, and the light
and thin ear bridle, above the heavy hand-wrought bit,
was decorated along the cheek straps with tapering rows
of silver conchas polished to mirror brightness. The
long reins he held high and light, and rode as though
he did not know that he was riding, his close-booted
feet light in the tapaderos. His horse, a silver-tail
sorrel, was a trifle jaded. If so, at early morning, the
coat rolled at the cantle most likely must have been his
blanket the night preceding; for it was far from Laguna
del Sol to the next open door of the range.</p>

<p class='pindent'>None of these matters escaped Taisie Lockhart, used
to reading and remembering men, cows and horses at a
glance. Her range education had taught her much, but
it was rather instinct told her that this man was neither
fop nor plain cow hand. He had an air about him, a
way with him, an eye in his head thereto; for Taisie
knew that, even as she had made inventory of him, he
had done as much or more with her, though he did not
salute as he jogged off to the door near which the ranch
hands now were standing. In sooth, Taisie had forgotten
for the time that, garbed as she was, she looked
like some long-limbed foppish boy who wore his hair
long down his shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Light, stranger!” Nabours gave the arrival the
usual greeting of the land. A dozen pairs of eyes gave
him appraisal of the range. But the etiquette of the
range was custom with this visitor. Though he was
forced to wheel his horse quite about to do so, he dismounted
on the same side of his horse as that which his
hosts held, and not upon the opposite, or hostile, side.
Moreover, he unbuckled his revolver belt and hung it
over the horn of his saddle before entering the door.
So! He had good manners. He was welcome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How, friends?” he said briefly, in return to the
greeting. “McMasters is my name. I’m from Gonzales.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know you,” said he. “You’re the new sher’f down
there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was asked no questions. Some of the men already
were saddling. The young horse wrangler was shaking
up the remuda in the round pen, men were roping their
mounts. Jim Nabours, foreman, and responsible for
hospitality, no more than moved a hand of invitation.
The newcomer seated himself at the long table, just
abandoned. The negro cook appeared, bearing renewals.
The guest ate in silence. Had Taisie seen him she would
have noted some indefinable difference in his table manners
from those of the cattle hands who but now had
left this same rude board; but he ate with no shrug of
criticism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours awaited his pleasure. Silence was the custom.
There were some silent moments before the
stranger pushed back and turned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had to lie out last night at the river,” said he.
“Fresh javelina isn’t bad if you like it. I rather prefer
your bacon here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours grinned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d orto have rid on in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The trail has changed since I was here. Of course,
I used to know Del Sol. My father, Calvin McMasters—you’ve
heard of him?—was a friend of Colonel
Burleson Lockhart forty years back. They died together,
and in the same way—you know how. But I
was away three years with my regiment, and lately I’ve
never got around to ride up the hundred miles from
the south.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re riding back from north now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Far?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From Arkansas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I came down the Washita and crossed the Red
at the Station, in from the Nations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How’s that country up in there for cows?” asked
Jim Nabours, with the cowman’s invariable interest in
new lands. “I never been acrost the Red. Palo Pinto’s
about the limit I make for hunting our cows on the
north.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good range all the way through the Nations; good
all the way from here across the Red and clean up to
what they call the Kansas line—that’s above the Cherokee
Outlet. I was in east, along the Arkansas line.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Water?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Plenty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours remained silent for a time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me, friend,” said he at length. “How about
Colonel Lockhart’s old notion? He worked some cows
north, like, on the Jess Chisholm Trail, up along the
Washita, north of the Red somewheres. Arkansaw
was where he went, and the last time he went he didn’t
never come back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The faces of both men were grave. The murder of
Burleson Lockhart and Calvin McMasters by the ruffians
of the Arkansas border was an open wound for
all Central Texas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Chisholm Trail isn’t any trail,” said the
stranger. “I came down that way myself, west of
Wichita, but Jesse never did herd anything much over
it. He did drive two-three little bunches from the Red
River to Little Rock, Arkansas, not over a thousand
head in all; but like as not he got the idea from my
father and Colonel Lockhart. They both always said
that Texas would have to find a market north.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, they all had the good old Texas idea about
starting a beef cannery to market our surplus cows.
Some folks called Fowlers started to pack at Little
Rock. Their meat all spoiled and it broke the whole
outfit. Jess Chisholm didn’t drive to Little Rock again.
And you know my father and Burleson Lockhart paid
their lives for their experiment. They wanted to do
something for Texas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Several men has tried driving cows into Arkansaw,
even Illinois, even Missoury and Ioway,” commented
the foreman of Del Sol. “Bad stories comes down—herds
stole by bushwhackers and desperadoes, drovers
robbed, stripped, tied up and whipped, drove out of the
country, sent home broke or else left dead like them two
good men. It’s bad along the Arkansaw and Missoury
border. Plenty others has been killed up there. Bad
business. Us Texans ought to even up a lot of things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes!” A sudden strange flash came into the gray
eye of the young stranger. “I ought to know!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours’ own keen eye narrowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not safe to drive that way? Don’t you think
that’s all foolishness?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has been, so far.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But then, men has done told me that Chisholm had
a right good road, grass and water, clean north.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, he didn’t do much. He only had an idea that’s
old in Texas—a beef market.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If Texas had a market for her beef! Eh? We’d
all be rich.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours tried to remain calm. The thought was by
no means new to him or to many other Texans, broad-minded
and farseeing men like those two early martyrs
of the trail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Jesse only followed the road that crossed the
Canadian at Roberts’ Ferry—the old Whisky Trail.
He headed west instead of north, after a while. He
went up the Brazos and west across to the Concho with
a bunch of cows. He knew there was a military market
at Fort Sumner, on the Pecos, over in New Mexico.
So he made the big two-day dry drive west of the
Concho. He hit the Pecos at the Horsehead Crossing
and worked up to Sumner. Loving and Goodnight had
a trail north of Sumner—clean up into Colorado. Army
posts and reservations all have got to have beef, and a
lot of it. Yes, that’s going to make a market some day.
If we herd the Indians they’ve all got to eat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Seguro!</span> Shore they have! They feed the damned
Comanches, and the Comanches shoot up and murder
every outfit that tracks west to the Pecos—every drive
out there means a half dozen Indian fights. No money
in that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, nor no money in anything that has anything to
do with cows,” Nabours continued. “Look at the record.
Rockport, Indianola, Galveston, Mobile, New
Orleans, Little Rock, Illinois, Ioway—all them foreign
countries, full of damn Yankees and thieves. What
ghostly chance has a Texas stockman got? I’d as soon
eat javelin’ as beef—it ain’t so common, and it costs
more. There’s cows thicker’n lizards all the way from
Matagorda to Doan’s Store on the Red, and west far’s
the Staked Plains. We’re busted, friend. The South
is licked. We’ve got a carpetbag government and no
hope of any change. If all Texas was worth one solitary
whoop in hell do you reckon you could buy a mile
square of vine-mesquite grass land for fourteen dollars?
Not that I would, or could—I haven’t got the fourteen
dollars. No, nor it don’t look like any stockman in this
whole state ever will have fourteen dollars, the whole
caboodle, from Santone to the Sabine. This is the
poorest place in the whole damned world, Texas is, and
I’m here for to prove it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim Nabours’ long-pent dissatisfaction had led him
into the longest speech of his entire life. He knew he
had an understanding hearer in this grave young man
from Gonzales, who nodded, noncommittal as heretofore.
Nabours went on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet,” said he vehemently, “why, now, Miss
Taisie, that owns this ranch brand, now, she wants to
try it again, north! Would you believe that? Wasn’t
her father murdered by them damned people that beat
up pore Jimmy Dougherty on the Missoury border two
years ago? Huh! He was crazy to drive north. What
did it bring him? His death, and the ruin of Del Sol!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That girl’s been wanting, all this month, to make up
a herd and drive north! Can you figure that out? Her
a child, you might say, wanting to do what her father
couldn’t do, and take chances that cost him his life!
Crazy, that’s all. But who ever changed a Lockhart?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now, right here, this very morning”—Nabours
beat on the table with his fist—“she comes in and declares
herself. Says she’s broke and can’t pay her
hands. Turns us all loose—every man! Her a girl
only twenty-two, a orphant at that, and not a soul to
take care of her! Great God! Well, that’s what cows
comes to in Texas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man nodded, still silent, his face grave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” resumed Nabours, “we wouldn’t go.
Shore, we ain’t had no wages for a spell; but who has?
And what has wages got to do with it, us working for
a orphant, and that particular orphant being the Del
Sol boss? Quit? Why I’ve worked on the brand forty
years, man and boy! I couldn’t quit nohow, if I tried.
She ought to know that. Makes me mad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps she thought of how her father always paid.
She has his sense of honor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we didn’t go. I just told the boys to go on
out and brand long ears, like we been doing since the
war. There ain’t no money in it. I did hope we’d have
a hard winter, to kill off some of the range stock. What
do we get? Two soft winters when the flies didn’t die!
Not a half of one per cent loss, and the whole ungodly
world getting so damned full of calves that a man
couldn’t make a living skinning dead stock on the water
fronts, not if he had twelve pairs of hands! Dead?
There ain’t no dead—they’re all alive! What’s worse,
they keep getting aliver. This whole state, come couple
more mild winters, ’ll turn into tails and horns. And
if I needed a new saddle or a pair of boots I’d have to
steal them. Yet that girl, she’s made life miserable for
me to drive three thousand head north and get some
money to pay us hands. You and me know that’s
foolish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it, though?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours looked at him suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ve just come down from that country.
To-day there’s something new up north.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“New?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, plumb new. I don’t mean Baxter Springs or
Little Rock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t mean a real market north!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is what I do mean! There’ll be money in
driving north after this spring.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours looked at him for a time in silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll have to show me how, Mr. McMasters. I
ain’t never been north of the Red, nor west of the
Concho, though south of the Rio Grande, plenty. What
I’ve learned is, a cow ain’t worth a damn, and any cow
man’s a idjit, and he can’t help keeping on being one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, listen! The Kansas Pacific Railroad is
building west across Kansas this spring as fast as they
can lay rails. At the last town—that’s Abilene—some
men pat their heads together on precisely this question
that’s got us all guessing. A cow is worth four dollars—three—nothing
down here. At the railroad he’s
worth ten, maybe more. East, he’s worth twenty,
maybe more. They need beef, and we’ve got beef, or
the making of it. It needs no watchmaking to figure
that this deadlock has got to break.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, they’ve taken a chance at Abilene; they’ve
put up shipping pens—so they told me at Wichita.
They said you could follow up the Washita and cross
the Canadian and go north; then hit in west of Wichita
and swing north across the Arkansas to Abilene. And
there’s the market, man!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the biggest news that ever came to Texas.
It’s bigger than San Jacinto. You know what that
means, if you could get a herd through? Well, I’d say
your boss had a good head on her shoulders.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours sat silent, stupefied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I came in here through Caldwell,” the visitor went
on now, explanatory. “I’ve ridden over a perfectly
practical trail for nearly a thousand miles so far as grass
and water are concerned. I thought I’d bring this news
in to Del Sol. I’ve known the Burleson Lockhart
family all my life, of course, and of the hard place
Colonel Lockhart’s daughter has been forced into by his
death. I wanted to ride in and see her, the first time
since we were children.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man colored just a trace as he went on.
“I wanted to bring her, as owner of a Texas brand, the
news of the new market,” said he. “Is she at home?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t you see her when you came in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McMasters hesitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw a young man. I didn’t just know——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The foreman smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I couldn’t blame you. Well, I’m the only mother
that girl has got left. I’m one hell of a mother! But
still, I don’t see why you didn’t ride on up to the front
door.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man’s face flushed rather hotly, but he
was guilty of no nervousness, did not even smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No man could come on better business,” said he.
“It was not her fault. She did not know me, nor
I her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must go on up to the house,” said Nabours.
“First tell me, what took you north?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McMasters looked at him in his cold way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said he finally, “I’m a peace officer. I’ve
been sheriff of Gonzales for six months. Perhaps you
haven’t heard the latest news about the Rangers. In
spite of our carpetbagging friends, they’re organized
again, stronger than before the war, and with more to
do. They gave me the honor of electing me a captain.
I’ve been up north on a certain business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours nodded now silently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s not a man here or in Central Texas that
ain’t sworn to kill the murderer of them two men, if
ever he is found. You know that, Mr. McMasters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes! Nor is your oath more strong than mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McMasters turned to the silent negro, who had
brought in a pan of water and a towel. As he turned
up his sleeves, the cuffs of his linen shirt—as the rolled
soft collar also might before then have disclosed—showed
a dull red, not white. He laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A superstition,” said he, nodding. “Sort of oath
of the family. In the war my mother had to dye her
own clothing with pokeberry. She dyed a few of my
father’s shirts that way by mistake once. My father
was so proud of our sacrifices to the cause—though he
didn’t think Texas should have seceded—that he swore
he’d never have collars or cuffs any other color. Well,
a new sheriff in Gonzales hasn’t so many shirts. This
one was once my father’s. Yes, we’re poor—poor, we
Texans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Turn my horse in the round pen, please, sir,” he
concluded, when he had made himself neat as possible.
“Would you please ask Miss Lockhart if she will see
Mr. Dan McMasters, the son of her father’s friend?”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span><h1>CHAPTER III<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE ORPHAN OF DEL SOL</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>B</span></span>LANCOCITO had dozed in the sun for a considerable
interval. Hearing a sound at the front
door, he turned an idle eye, and sprang back with
a snort at sight of the unusual apparition which now
descended the gallery steps—Anastasie Lockhart, no
longer in male apparel, and by the merest accident coming
out of the house as the two men would now have
entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim Nabours was not accustomed to social formulas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Taisie, this here is Mr. McMasters, of Gonzales,
below. He’s sher’f down there. I reckon you
know who he is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw you when you came in, sir,” said the mistress
of Del Sol demurely, extending her hand. “Why did
you not come up to breakfast?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While McMasters, his eyes fixed on hers, was explaining
his travel-worn condition, Jim Nabours was
wondering how and why in the name of all the saints
of the Southwest Taisie had managed in so short a time
to change from her daily ranch costume to this feminine
marvel of fresh lawn, with ruffled flounces and great
belled skirt. She even had white mitts—yellow-white
with age. But Taisie saw no reason to explain that
much of her apparel once had been her mother’s, and
was now fresh resurrected. Jim did not know the mysteries
of a certain rawhide chest so well as old black
Milly, who had served in the Burleson Lockhart family
before they moved into the border country. Had he
known he might also have had a guess at the miracle
of Taisie’s heavy hair, no longer banded like an Indian
woman’s but done up in some sort of high twisted mass
that left visible the milk-white nape of a neck not always
otherwise protected against the sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In good truth Anastasie—such was her mother’s
Louisiana name in baptism, and her own—was not unmindful
of the ways of woman in older lands, in spite
of the surroundings into which fate had cast her. And
truly she was beautiful—rarely, astonishingly, confusingly
beautiful. The man did not live who could have
seen her now and not have felt his heart leap to joy in
the universe and its ways.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She led them back into the house. Her very presence
filled the low-ceiled room, one of the two at the right
of the four corners made by the right-angled double
halls. The adobe ranch house of Del Sol was built like
others of the Saxon Southwest, so that each breath of
air might be caught from any direction of the wind; an
arrangement cooler than a patio for a house surrounded
on two sides by a grove of giant live oaks draped heavily
in Spanish moss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The interior gave a rude setting for a picture such as
this young woman made. The ease and luxury of lower
Louisiana, for a wealthy generation of sugar-cane
planters the repository of Europe’s best art and last
luxuries, were not reflected in the first Saxon generation
of the Texas border. True, the furniture in part
was traceable to earlier days. Two paintings, three
framed samplers, told of a mother’s hands. There was
a heavy claw-foot table. A few mismated chairs of the
Empire stood in a row. But a rawhide settee and four
splat-bottom chairs frankly admitted the limit of such
supplies; the prevailing flavor of the borderland could
not be denied. Not so much of a marvel, for at that
time there was not a hundred miles of railroad within
the boundaries of Texas, and everything from the East
must survive the toil and danger of wagon freighting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In one corner of the room was a conical upright
Mexican fireplace. Opposed to this and covered with
soft tanned baby-calfskins of varied colors, stood the
one thing which had saved the soul of Anastasie Lockhart
the first, as of Anastasie the second—the piano,
regarded with awe by all the cattle hands. On the piano
stood, now, a vase of flowers. They were very fresh
flowers. Jim Nabours knew they had not been there an
hour earlier, for he had called before breakfast and they
were not there then; though he knew Taisie’s garden
had some blossoms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What shall escape the eye of a maiden? Tapered
conchas on a bridle strap, neat boots, a well-shaped hat,
a way of sitting in a saddle, the air of a family that had
once come down from Tennessee on the Natchez Trace
and the Old River Road, to Louisiana, to Texas? Nay,
not so easily are a maid’s eyes baffled, though she shall
have had but a single look at a newcome young man
opening her gate a hundred yards away. Hence these
flowers, hence this frock, the reason for which Jim
Nabours could not analyze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Dan McMasters, new sheriff of Gonzales, mighty
young for that job, was a proper man. A vague sense
of uneasiness came to the soul of Foreman Jim as he
saw his comeliness and ease of manner. He felt he had
been betrayed—did not feel familiar with these new
little ways.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, Miss Lockhart,” went on McMasters when
he had taken his own seat on the cowhide settee, “I’ve
been north, up the Indian roads. As I was only fifty
miles away, I thought I would ride in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are very welcome, sir. Our families always
have been friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The voice of Anastasie Lockhart was the color of
her hair. Almost, you could call her hair vibrant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, my family always has known your family. I
wanted to see you once more. That must have been my
main reason. You—you have grown, Miss Lockhart.
I’d not have known you. But just now I was talking
with your segundo. He thought you might like to hear
some word I am bringing down to Texas from the
North.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He means they’ve started a cattle market up North
on the railroad, Miss Taisie,” broke in Jim Nabours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Market? There’s going to be a shipping point—do
you mean that, sir?” The girl turned swiftly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think so, yes,” replied Dan McMasters. “It’s at
Abilene, in Kansas, right north of Wichita. You see,
Wichita’s not far across the Kansas line, above the
Nations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Abilene?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No one ever heard of it. It’s head of the rails on
the Kansas Pacific, the new road that’s building west.
They want cattle. They are promising a market.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl’s eyes kindled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s news!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. The railroads are planning to run up the
Arkansas the same as up the Platte—and that’s done,
now. That whole country north of here, from all I can
hear about it, is a thousand by two thousand miles of
natural cow land. Grass? They tell me that farther
on west there’s millions of acres of what they call buffalo
grass—short, like our grama. Maybe it won’t carry
cows, but some say it will. It certainly fattens the
buffalo. And there isn’t a cow in it all; it’s empty and
waiting for range stock—to say nothing of the Eastern
demand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours broke in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We know we could herd as far as Wichita. Shore
we could get from there to Aberlene.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said this prophet of a new day; “and we
would find Eastern buyers—farmers and feeders and
beef men—waiting to buy our stuff as fast as we drove
it through.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really?” Taisie Lockhart almost forgot her morning’s
troubles. “Really?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, yes, I reckon it’s true, from what the men
told me that came down to cut the trail in the Nations.
They declare there’ll be buyers for all we can drive, up
to a hundred thousand head—yes, two-three hundred
thousand!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Inarticulate sound came in Anastasie’s throat. She
cast a triumphant glance at her foreman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, now, ma’am, how was I to know?” defended
Jim. “I never did hear of no Aberlene, not in my whole
life, till this young gentleman rid in here this morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you ought to have heard of it!” rejoined his
employer with a woman’s logic. “Why, man, that’s
what all Texas has been starving for for years! Didn’t
I tell you? Haven’t I been telling you? Haven’t I been
begging you to make a herd and drive north, somewhere,
and trust to God to find buyers there, since
there’s no hope here, south or east? Haven’t I told
you, Jim?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon you did, ma’am,” admitted her aid. “Same
time, you didn’t know a damned thing about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you!” Taisie turned to him. “Do you expect
to have people show you what’s in their hands before
you draw cards? Can’t you take a chance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For my own self, yes, Miss Taisie. For you—we
all was scared. Especial we was scared when you said
you was going along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I am going along! And I am going to put up
a herd!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Miss Lockhart,” ventured Dan McMasters,
“you couldn’t do that. Your men can put up a herd
and drive north for you, but no woman ever has gone
north of the Red, or ever ought to try it. There’s no
real trail—it’s all wild north of here for fifteen hundred
miles or more. There’s not a bridge—I’ve swum ten
rivers and forded a hundred. There are Indians.
There are storms—and no shelter for you. Miss Lockhart,
there’s not a man in Texas ever would let you go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s not men enough in all Texas to keep me
from going!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taisie’s grief was entirely forgotten now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even your father——” Jim began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t!” Sudden tears came to the girl’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She allus bogs down—about her father,” explained
Nabours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll not bog down! I’ll get over this some day.
Why, the reason I want to go north is to find the man
that did it! He’s somewhere up there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McMasters, captain in the Rangers, looked at her
with a sudden kindling of his own cool eyes; but he
said nothing. The mistress of Del Sol stamped her
foot in its cross-banded slipper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Always you treat me like a girl. I’m not!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you are, Miss Taisie,” rejoined Jim Nabours.
“You’re a girl, and I’m your mother and your father
both, till you get a new segundo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen at him!” Taisie turned to the young
stranger. “The whole state of Texas is dying on its
feet, and the men of Texas scared to drive, with maybe
five dollars a head waiting for them at the railroad!
That’s riches!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long would it take?” she demanded of her
informant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All season, practically,” replied McMasters. “I rode
about forty miles a day, coming south, and I was eleven
hundred miles away at one time. Cows could go ten
miles a day, maybe, if you could keep the herd going;
say two-three hundred miles a month. Say three-four
months—that would cover a heap of trail.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the distance between here and heaven! All the
difference between poverty and self-respect! Oh!”—she
looked him fair in the face—“it’s no use to pretend!
Do you know what I did this very morning, sir, just
before you rode in? Do you know why I’m crying
now? I can’t help it. Why, I was down there to tell
my men that I’d turned them all loose this morning.
I discharged them all. I told them I was broke, that I
couldn’t pay my hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor? Don’t I know! Go back to Gonzales and
tell your people that the last Lockhart’s down in the
dust. I’ve got no pride left at all, because I’m broke.
Do you wonder that I cry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She did!” said Jim Nabours. “She is!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McMasters turned away and looked out the window.
The tears of such a woman made one thing no man
could face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, of course,” added the foreman, “I taken all
that in my own hands. I just sont the hands out like
usual. Seems like I can hear the irons sizzling on about
a dozen long ears by now already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the lot not worth a pinch of old Milly’s snuff!”
commented Taisie. “The market—that’s the one thing!
Mr. McMasters has brought news!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I almost hesitate over it,” said the young man. “I
can’t bring it free of risk and danger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t know my men!” broke out Taisie
proudly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, I do! I know us all, ma’am. They—we
would all die first. But suppose that was not enough?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if I’m a woman, at least I’m not an old woman.
I’ll drive the first Texas herd to the railroad with my
own men if it takes our last horse and last man! It’s
north for me, or I’m gone. When you rode in, sir, I
was at the lowest ebb of all my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish the tide may turn, Miss Lockhart,” said
young Dan McMasters quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will—I believe it has!” She was on her feet, her
eyes bright, her color up. “Why, listen! I’ll take Anita
and Milly both along. We’ve two carretas left. Jim,
you old coward”—her hand was on his shoulder affectionately—“you
know you told me you could make a
herd of five thousand fours in our brand inside of
a day’s ride from Del Sol. Even if it was beeves——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me, what ages?” She turned suddenly to
McMasters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t say yet,” was his reply. “Fours and long
threes would do best for shipping East. But the talk
I heard is that there’ll be use for stockers—even yearlings,
too, because the range is open all in north and
west of there. People are crowding out to the buffalo
range, following the railroads. It’s unbelievable how
crazy they are. It seems as though they felt they just
have got to get West. They’ll all need cattle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A new expression came to his face as he went on:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s millions of acres of unbroken land up there,
north of the old slavery line of 36-30. It will take
North and South both to make it. It will be the West!
It will be the heart of America!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll be the first to see it! There’s no age from
calf to fifty years Del Sol can’t drive!” said Taisie
Lockhart decisively. “How many?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That depends on your force of hands. Some said
three thousand head was around what a herd should be.
A dozen hands could drive it—say fifteen-twenty. Each
man ought to have at least six or eight horses in his
string. There’ll be riding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what of that? I can turn out twenty men who
can talk to cows in their own language. We wouldn’t
miss thirty-five hundred fours, Jim says. When shall
we start?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She still was smiling, eager; but the look in her eyes
was one of resolution; and as Jim had said, a Lockhart
never changed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jesse Chisholm just followed the grass,” answered
McMasters presently. “It’s green here in March, and
it’s February now. Once across the Colorado and the
Brazos, we’d go clean to the Red, easy—I know my
father always said that. He said a driver could go in
west of Austin and Fort Worth, and get to the north
edge of Texas and be almost sure not to see an Indian.
The Comanches are away west of that line. We’re
about on the ninety-eighth meridian here, and near the
thirtieth parallel. My father said that it was a new
world north of thirty-six degrees north latitude. That
land is all unmapped. No one lives there but the
Indians.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She eats Comanches,” said Jim Nabours. “Little
thing like them don’t bother her none. As for swimming
a herd acrost a spring fresh, with quicksand on
both sides, why, she don’t mind that none a-tall!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An ominous silence and a heightened color did not
impress him. At length his employer went on, addressing
the visitor:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well. Say fifteen men and a wrangler and a
cook, with me and black Milly, my cook, and Anita, my
Spanish woman. We’d take the two carretas, with oxen
for them and the cook’s wagon. Sixteen riders by six
or eight horses is a hundred or a hundred and fifty for
the remuda—we’d do it easy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Plumb easy!” came Jim’s solemn comment. “A
thousand miles in a carreta without a spring, right over
a crooked mesquite ex, is right simple. About one week
and Milly’d die, her going three hundred net right now;
and Anita’d die of homesickness for her jacal she’s used
to living in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Besides, ma’am”—here the foreman’s voice changed—“I
may as well talk plain. Not joking, we can’t live
on beef straight. Three-four months of meal and beans
and molasses for twenty men is more than we have got,
though meal and beans and molasses and side meat we’d
have to have, and coffee if we could. The hands work
better for coffee, mornings, and after rains or hard
rides.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The color on poor Taisie’s cheeks grew deeper in
humiliation. She spread out her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m broke! I’ve said that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was silence for some time. At length the
young sheriff of Gonzales spoke quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Lockhart,” said he, “I don’t like to hear that
word in Texas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Truth is the simplest!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know. But what one ranch in Texas doesn’t
happen to have the neighbors do have—they always
have had. Take in one or two neighbors with you for
the drive—say a thousand head, each brand. They’d
be glad to put up the wagon and the remuda. You must
not push away your neighbors. This is Texas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A cold rage met his sincerity and friendliness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll have help from no one! Del Sol will drive a
lone herd north, win or lose. I’ll take it all back, Jim—you’re
all hired on again, the last man of you. You’ll
stand by me? I’ll sell my cows and pay my men; and
then I’ll see if there’s any law in the North or any men
in the South to help me find a murderer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ma’am,” said Jim Nabours, “you’ve put it now
so’s’t not one of us can help hisself. We got to go.
When hell freezes we’ll all walk out on the ice together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you got to thank Mr. McMasters for what he’s
done told us, Miss Taisie,” he added. “I reckon he’s
our best neighbor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do thank you, sir!” The girl rose and held out
her hand frankly. The young man bent over it. He
did not seat himself again. “But you’ll stop a day or
so with us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I must be riding now,” he answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found his hat, bowed, passed out the door with
no dallying or indecision; nor said a word about return.
He was abrupt to coldness, if not to rudeness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anastasie Lockhart looked through the window
shades so intently that her hand remained not fallen
after it had drawn them; so intently that she did not
hear old Milly as she entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Laws, Miss Taisie, is that young gemman gone?
I done brung in some likker fer him. He’s quality,
Miss Taisie! Who is he, an’ whah he come from? Is
he done ask you about marryin’ yit?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not yet, Milly,” answered Anastasie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat down in the one rocking-chair, staring at the
uncarpeted floor. She was older now than she had been
an hour ago. Why had this neighbor not promised an
early return? And was he not a strangely stiff and
silent young man? Were the honors of sheriff and captain
so much as to render him superior to a girl with
red hair who wore her mother’s clothes, years old?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anastasie Lockhart, astonishingly vital, astonishingly
beautiful, rose to find a mirror so that she could
read an answer. As she did so she recognized, standing
at the end of the rawhide settee, where her visitor could
not have failed to see the sudden disorder of its interior,
the rawhide trunk which long had served alike as wardrobe
and safety vault for her. Vexed at the revelation
of her first untidiness in housekeeping, she bent now to
close the heavy lid once more. Suddenly she went to her
knees beside it, her eyes wet once more at what she saw
of silk and lace gone to bits. She caught up the fragments
to her cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A daguerreotype in its disintegrating frame lay to
her hand. She opened it. Her mother. Yes, she had
been beautiful. And this frame was the twin of it—her
father. She turned it to catch the light so that the likeness
would show. A bold, bearded face, aquiline, high.
She sighed as she looked at the picture of a man cut
down by an assassin in the full of his strength and
resolution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Below these things and others lay to half the depth
of the old chest a mass of papers, all similar. Contemptuously
she thrust in her hands, her arms, to the
elbows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Scrip!” she murmured to herself. “Scrip for more
Texas land, to raise more Texas cows! He was mad
about it—scrip, scrip was all he thought! I only hope
that he did not see it!” She meant Dan McMasters.
“But of course he did—he couldn’t help it, where he sat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s no matter,” she added mentally. “He’s
not coming back again. If I’d known how cold he was
I’d not have troubled!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She spread out her long brown hands over her
mother’s frock as, still kneeling, she sat back on
her heels, in her mother’s cross-banded shoes.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span><h1>CHAPTER IV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE FOOT OF THE TRAIL</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>T</span></span>HE sun-drenched landscape of the Southwest
lay warm, indolent, full of somber fire. The
home buildings rested in the arm of a great
live-oak grove, opposite whose opening appeared a
wide land of rolling contours, now almost in the thin
green of coming spring. Six miles away the tree lines
showed a stream, and beyond that, as most folk knew,
lay the great lake which originally had led Burleson
Lockhart to take up this range. This side and that ran
miles of mesquite, stretching south, tall cactuses showing
betimes among the twisted thorny trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a little-known corner of America, in what one
day was to be known as the great breeding range, last
of the holdings above the Rio Grande to fall from the
lax hand of Spain. The lack of rain left the vegetation
anguished. A thousand distorted souls in torment lived
in these gray trees. Soon the direct sun rays would
again be searing into brown the new and tender grass,
though it scarce had had its one annual chance to gasp
in green.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A lizard scuttled across the dust of the dooryard. A
road-runner sped along the fence of poles and rawhide,
bent on its own mission. War was marked in every
sign and token of Texas from its very first. No manner
of pest and curse ever lacked in its cynically indifferent
confines. Starvation, thirst, filled these mud-thickened
bayous every year with hundreds of dead
horses. The bones of cattle lay uncounted for a thousand
miles, each dried hide and rack of whitening bones
enriching soil that had no answer to its own fecundity
in animal life. To live, to breed and to die—that was
all that animal life there could do. Nothing to the dead
creature that it had never known the shambles. The
rack of bones was good enough for Spain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But now had come Saxon men. Texas, savage,
abounding, multiplying undisturbed, was now for the
first time seeking outlet for her superabundant life,
which for fifty years had increased undisturbed. Texas
owned millions of worthless cattle; how many, no
owner knew, nor could any man tell how far his cows
ranged. He did not care. Unbranded cattle still ran
in thousands. No one hunted strays, and the increase
of strays belonged without reservation to the land that
fed them. There was no cattle association, no general
rodeo; and the home gatherings never claimed to be
complete. Title, whether in land or cattle, was much a
matter of indifference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of law there was little. A vast and unknown empire
was controlled by a rude baronry whose like the world
has never seen; who later were vastly to extend that
empire and its ways.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These men set up the one great law of custom. The
custom of the range was based on the natural habits of
the cattle and the natural peculiarities of the grazing
lands. The accepted brand, the right of the finder to
an unowned range or water front, the tendency of cattle
to cling to home, the law of natural probability in all
things—such were rigid natural laws which no man
might ignore with safety. As animal life ran wild, so
also did human life, one no more restrained than the
other. Only the saving grace of the Saxon instinct for
some sort of law brought Texas, literally born in the
wilderness, up to what she is to-day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no market. At least, rambling and unconcerted
attempts had found none till now. After the
Civil War a seething unrest passed over all Texas. The
demand for some sort of market was first in the thought
of all men who owned nothing but cows and reasoned
only in terms of cows.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s going to drive!” said Jim Nabours to his
new-found friend as they crossed the Del Sol dooryard.
“That’s her pap’s old idee. What you’ve said
cinches it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes? When can you begin the herd?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old cowman’s face clouded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen here! Keep what I tell you. That girl
knows a lot about cows, but a heap of things about her
own cows she don’t know. She knows how many her
father had and she thinks she’s got more. She hain’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Combed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, combed! We’re too close to Austin! Hide
hunters and calf hunters and plain thieves and politics—that’s
since the war. The damn Yankees are trying to
run a country they don’t know nothing about. All
Central Texas has took to hunting cows. This here’s a
good place for thieves—or for men who can see ahead
a little ways.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We didn’t know it till just now, but there must of
been a band of skinners and slick hunters working our
range all last winter and winter afore. She ain’t got
one cow now where she thinks she’s got fifty. What
could we do? We didn’t know, and don’t know, who
done it; but we didn’t durst to let her really know it was
did. Now, she’s going to find out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But surely you can make up a mixed herd anyhow!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, maybe. But if we do hit a market, where’ll
we round up the next herd for her? Some one else has
got our cows. There’s a big steal been going on in
Central Texas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, we done our damnedest to take care of her
and not let her know. God ha’ mercy on me! I’m the
worstest perjured liar in Texas, and that’s a big claim.
We’ve had a rodeo now and then, here at the home
place, but she didn’t know how fur we driv some of
them cows!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how could we fool her if we put up a big herd?
She kin read a brand as well as us. We’d road brand,
I reckon—yes; but that wouldn’t change the facts none.
She’d ketch on. She ain’t no fool, that girl. What do
you say, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I say start your round-up to-morrow! Keep
in the T. L., the Del Sol brand, or do the best you can.
It will come to a show-down anyhow before long, so
why wait? Let hers be the first herd north of the Red
this spring. While the others are thinking it over, let’s
be up the trail! Believe me, all Texas will be moving
north before long!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She pops!” said Jim Nabours suddenly. He had
decided.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long to make the herd?” McMasters also
kindled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two weeks. We could brand out within another
two, only we’ll have to rope and throw. Our pens won’t
hold. We got no chute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Build one to-day. It will pay you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours looked at the newcomer curiously with an
eye not free of suspicion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You taken a mighty interest.” He spoke slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have! I want to go up the trail with you-all. I’ve
reason for going north again. My business there wasn’t
settled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what’s your reasons for being so brash about
coming in with us? I dunno’s I’ve give you leave, and
I know the boss didn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two reasons. One I’ve told you—the business that
took me north and brought me south will take me north
again. Never mind what that is. I’m a captain of
Rangers, and we can’t talk. The other reason you can
guess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon I do guess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Muy bien!</span> Our families both came in with Stephen
Austin. They both had men massacred with Fannin
at Goliad. They both had men in the Alamo. Her
father and mine were both killed up the trail. Do you
think any McMasters would let any Lockhart starve?
Listen! You say she’s poor; say her range is skinned.
Tell her nothing—but please let a McMasters help a
Lockhart. Let me send you fifty horses and two wagonloads
of grub. You needn’t let her know. Make it a
loan or gift, either way you please. And let me ride
with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A surprising irrelevancy marked Jim Nabours’ next
remark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That girl can marry twenty-seven men to-morrow
morning. She ain’t going to marry no one until she
knows who killed Burleson Lockhart. ‘Bring me the
man that finds my father’s murderer,’ says she, ‘and I
believe I’d marry him.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She said that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Si, señor.</span> Maybe meant it, or thought she did.
You can’t tell much about no woman, and least of all
about Burleson Lockhart’s daughter. One thing, she’ll
be slow to quit anything she starts. She’s sot now on
driving. I reckon she will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By now they had approached the cook house and the
corral. McMasters had his bridle from the saddle that
straddled the pole near the bunk-house door. Soon he
had his horse under saddle. His pistol belt was now
in place again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The foreman looked at it curiously as the two walked
toward the rawhide gate. Nabours pushed it open. As
he did so a warning rattle sounded almost underfoot.
He sprang back with an oath. With the word came a
shot, not from his own weapon. The brown body of
the serpent was flung writhing, headless. McMasters’
pistol was back at its belt when Nabours turned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who done that?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did,” said McMasters. “You’d have stepped on
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if I want to step on a rattler, that’s my business,
ain’t it? Maybe I like to step on them. You
shooting made me jump. Still, quick work, huh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you a good shot?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was elected sheriff of Gonzales. I am a captain
in the Texas Rangers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His face was grave as he spoke, sad rather than
boastful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that?” suddenly exclaimed Jim Nabours.
“Listen!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sound of hoofs had come suddenly from around
the bend of the trail that wound through the mesquite
thicket screening the gate; hoofs of more than one
animal, not coming but going.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sound of the young man’s voice deterred
Nabours as much as his hand. He stood, absorbed,
frowning, listening to the receding hoof beats. The
rhythm told him the horses had riders. At last he
beckoned to Nabours. The two set out down the trail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here!” said Dan McMasters at length as they
rounded the bend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At a clump of huisache the tracks of six horses could
be seen making a trampled spot back of the bushes.
It all was plainly visible to eyes experienced as these.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They was tied!” said Jim Nabours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McMasters nodded, bending over the bruised stems
which the reins had covered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They must have closed up a lot last night,” said
Dan McMasters cryptically, as though to himself.
“They couldn’t have been far off this morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, Mr. Rattler!” He smiled grimly as he
kicked at a crooked stick for substitute of the dead
snake. “You served me a good turn!”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span><h1>CHAPTER V<br/> <span class='sub-head'>MARRIAGE, COWS AND CARPETBAGS</span></h1></div>

for some time, looking down the trace whither
the late visitor had disappeared. His head
was dropped forward, as one in studious distrust of his
own judgment; a frown yet more wrinkled his forehead.
At length he turned and found his way, not to
the corrals, but to the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blancocito still stood dozing in the sun. The mistress
of Del Sol was not riding this morning. Jim
knocked at the front door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He entered. Taisie was sitting at the end of the
rawhide settee, still in her bravest finery. Her hands
lay in her lap; her eyes were somber, clouded; doubt,
distrust appeared her portion also.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had looked about her with appraising eye; had
reflected also. All about, in every token, she saw evidences
of lapse, of retrogression, of decay, indeed of
poverty rapidly running to seed. The lack of a strong
hand was not to be denied. Moreover, the conditions
of this property were reflected all over a state, where
not even the strongest hand or the clearest mind had
been able to achieve solution. It was the hour of travail
for a great, unknown, forgotten country. Taisie Lockhart
might have known that the travail of a country is
only the multiple of many individual pains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked now at her faithful henchman, silent for
a time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, ma’am——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Jim?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours dropped into a chair, gripping the legs
with twining spurred feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was going to ast you how you liked this Gonzales
man, ma’am. He’s went now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were you taking a shot at him for luck, Jim? I
heard a shot.” She tried to smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No’m. It was him. A rattler was by the gate.
He shot its head off. I must say he done it quick and
easy too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he can ride.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uh-huh—and shoot. Yes, I reckon. Fact is, he’s
got a reputation now, for a young man. He’s the
youngest sher’f in Texas, like enough. He’s only in
six months, and in that time his county has done
shrunk more’n a thousand population. He ain’t killed
that many, ma’am—no; but he has done killed four
or five, and them bad. Then when the Rangers was
pulled together again and him put in as a captain, a
good many of them people taken the hint and moved.
It was time. Down there and in Uvalde there was
plenty of men that didn’t own a head or a acre, who’d
agree to put you up a herd of five thousand head on a
month’s notice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tell you, ma’am, the times is bad. The cow business
in this state is in one hell of a fix.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well, it
takes good shooting to be a sher’f, let alone a Ranger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Four? Four men? He killed them?” A sort of
horror was in her voice, her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In duty, ma’am. It don’t hardly count.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He did not look—like that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huh! He didn’t? Well, I’d say he did! When he
put on his guns they was two, and he wore his right-hand
gun pointing back and his left-hand one pointing
forward. I never seen no man do that before. If that
don’t look perfessional killer I ain’t no jedge. Now,
which gun he done use to kill the rattler I never could
tell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He makes me study, ma’am. His eye is cold as
ice. He don’t talk and he don’t laugh. He’s got something
on his mind. Somehow——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d trust him, Jim?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ef he was on my side. But how in hell can you
tell by looking at him whose side he is on?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Four men! Yes”—her voice trailed off—“I
thought he was—well, cold. He never did—start.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; and most does, Miss Taisie. And you that
was dressed up your best for him; and him a stranger
you hadn’t saw sence he was a boy, and hadn’t spoke to
now till he come in and seen you. And he didn’t start!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Taisie, I’ve set in some games, but I can’t read
that feller’s game. He’s friendly, but he’s so damned
mysterious I can’t get no line on him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What brought him here, Jim?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You, Miss Taisie! You bring ’em all here. Trouble
is, all that comes is dead broke; no more’n a saddle and
a pair of spurs to their name. But the McMasters
family ain’t broke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, one thing is shore, Miss Taisie: This here
can’t go on forever. I ain’t no good at advice to womenfolks;
all I can advise is cows and caballos. But it looks
plain to me that before long, you being a orphant, you
got to be married to some kind of a man. Peaceable
ef we can, by force ef we must, it looks plain to me,
which am both yore paw and maw, Miss Taisie, we
got to get you-all married. It can’t no ways run on
this way much furder’n what it has.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A dimple came in each of Anastasie Lockhart’s
brown cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Jim?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But not to this man, no matter what he do, Miss
Taisie! Not till I can clean up my own mind. I’m
oncertain on him somehow. Friends and neighbors he
ought to be—shore he ought. But Calvin McMasters,
his dad, was agin slavery and secession, and your paw
was with the South he was raised in. Them two was
friends. I wouldn’t call the McMasterses damn Yankees.
But I can’t place him yet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, how about Del Williams? You know he’s
been waiting and hoping. He went to the war because
you wouldn’t. He hung on with old Kirby Smith to
the last, wondering ef you would. He’s come back
after the surrender, hoping you would. He’s a good
honest boy, that wears one gun one way and saves
his money, when he gets any. He’s a good segundo
and he knows cows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that all I may ask?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl’s voice was almost wistful. True, she was
of the border. But she had seen the wider world.
There were books on shelves in that very room. The
portraits of her father and her mother were faces of
aristocrats. Their lives had been those of adventurers.
To know cows? Was that all the husband of the
daughter of these two needed to possess?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Taisie, cows is all we got—and we ain’t got
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it, Jim. I told you this morning, I’m broke.
I was going to sell out, move out. I was going to try
to teach school, or something, over East somewhere.
Jim, it’s awful to be poor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s awfuler when you ain’t been always, Miss
Taisie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’ll not be, now! We’re going to drive!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You say so, ma’am. It sounds so easy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why can’t we? Tell me? Haven’t I got cow hands
working for me? Haven’t I got fifty thousand cows in
the T. L.? You say sixty-five thousand. Isn’t the
world full of grass and water north of here? Didn’t
you hear what he told you—hasn’t my father told you—that
there’s a whole other world waiting up north, not
a man nor a cow nor a horse in it, hardly; just waiting?
Jim, the time to make money is when times are bad.
If we haven’t got cash we’ve got sand. This may be a
time of despair or a time of opportunity. It’s always
been that way, all over the world. When some despair
others win—if they’ve sand to do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You talk like a book I read oncet, ma’am. It was
full of maximuns.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taisie stamped her foot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll put up a herd and trail it! I’ll go along!
We’ll be utterly broke—or else we’ll win!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t go along, Miss Taisie. No woman
could.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I will!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You make things right hard for yore segundo, Miss
Taisie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jim! Jim! Don’t talk that way! Don’t you think
I know? Isn’t all this hard for me too? But if we
have luck I’ll make it easier for you-all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re just a girl, Miss Taisie. Let’s get married
first, huh? I don’t mean me. How about you and
Del?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl rose, a native imperiousness in her gesture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leave those things to me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, all right, all right,” sighed Nabours. “But
maybe you’ll leave some things to me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old range man rose and spread his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Taisie,” said he, “fire me! I’m the damnedest
liar in Texas!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean, Jim?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am. I been lying to you. You ain’t got no cows
left, hardly. Our range has been combed and skinned;
for two years it’s been going on—I don’t know how
long before. You ain’t got no sixty-five nor fifty thousand
cows. You’re lucky if you can put up a herd of
four thousand. We’ve all lied to you. We couldn’t
tell you the truth. Ma’am, this outfit would all lay
down and die for you. They’d do almost anything but
tell you the truth. We couldn’t do that. We didn’t
have the nerve.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl sank back, her face pale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Jim! I didn’t really know!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, ma’am. Some gang’s at work in here, and
north and west of here—far north as Palo Pinto.
We’ve been away, enduring the war and after the war.
We’re all broke, us Texans. But in Austin is plenty
people ain’t broke none a-tall. We don’t know nothing,
can’t prove nothing. All I say is, in Austin is
plenty people ain’t broke a-tall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean the Yankee treasurer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t say out loud what I do mean. All I know
is, our range is skinned; and I know we’re up against a
strong game. That’s why, ma’am, looking for the best
of Del Sol and what yore paw meant for her, and
looking for yore own good interests, too, I been advising
you to get married. That’d simple up a lot of things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, then we could settle down and raise cows.
We could build up the range again. They ain’t going
to be so brash about things when they know they’s a
real man in charge of Del Sol. But a orphant is easy
picking for a man like Rudabaugh and his gang of
carpetbagging thieves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean Rudabaugh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shore do. In Austin, we don’t know what’s going
on. In office and out, there’s a new gang in there.
They’re organized fer to steal this here whole state,
lock, stock and barrel. They don’t stop at nothing.
They allow the war ain’t never done; that us Texans
ain’t never surrendered; that Lee’s still a enemy; and
that all this state is fair picking fer men that wasn’t
never borned nor raised in Texas, orphants and all.
They got wide idees, yes. But they ain’t idees that was
borned in Texas, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And are we helpless, Jim?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damn nigh it, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But surely we could raise two or three thousand
head, of some sort, to drive north this spring. Leave
them the empty house, Jim! Leave them the Del Sol
round pen without a horse in it! Leave them our
range—empty! But by the Lord——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smote fist in palm, walked. Her foreman’s
fighting blood kindled at the flame of the old courage
that had brought families into this wilderness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, by the Lord! Taisie, child, ef ever we do get
on our feet, us Texans, we’ll line up against them people
and we’ll see it through!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then we’ll drive, Jim?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, we’ll drive! Ef it takes the last hoof, we’ll
drive this spring, come grass. I don’t know nothing
about the country; I never driv a herd so fur, and no
one else never has. But ef you’ll let us do our very
best, we’ll bust north inside of thirty days!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He caught both her long brown hands in his own
gnarled and crooked ones, his stubbled face grave, his
gray eyes troubled; a figure not impressive in his broken
boots, his torn checked trousers, but with a sincerity
proved these years since his boyhood under this girl’s
father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll take it fair, child, ef we do the best we can
fer you! You’ll never holler?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know I never will, Jim. And you know I’ll
go along and I’ll go through.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord help you, Miss Taisie! And Lord help us
too! There’s been times when my job seemed a heap
easier than what it does right now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Author’s Note.</span>—There is no Gregg, no Parkman,
no Chittenden for the lost and forgotten cattle trail.
Although almost as important as the east-and-west railroads
in the early development of the trans-Missouri, it
has no map, no monument, no history, almost no formulated
condition. There is a comprehensive literature
covering our westbound expansion, but of the great
north-and-south pastoral road almost the contrary must
be said, such is the paucity of titles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The classic of the cattle trade of the West is a crude
book, now rare, by Joseph G. McCoy, called <span class='it'>Historic
Sketches of the Cattle Trade of the West and Southwest.</span>
It is upon this book that the author has rested most largely
in endeavoring to restore the feel of the early cattle drives.
It was printed in 1874.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within the past two years Mr. George W. Saunders, of
San Antonio, Texas, has printed a book, <span class='it'>The Trail Drivers
of Texas</span>, containing brief life stories from the pens of
more than a hundred men who trailed cattle before and
after the railroad days. These sketches are human documents.
The author wishes to acknowledge obligations to
this work, which he has used almost literally in many
passages for the sake of known accuracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The books of Andy Adams—<span class='it'>The Log of a Cowboy</span>;
<span class='it'>Wayne Anthony</span>, Cow Man; <span class='it'>Wells Brothers</span>; <span class='it'>A Texas
Matchmaker</span>; The Outlet—make the most authentic fiction
or quasi fiction of the trail days. Mr. Adams made trips
on northern drives, his experience beginning in 1882. His
books are storehouses of later trail data. The author
makes acknowledgment to that source of information.
Records of army exploration also have been useful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The quasi biography of Chas. A. Siringo, <span class='it'>A Lone Star
Cowboy</span>, is still another, and very useful record of life in
the early Southwest. It abounds in facts as well as in
thrilling incidents. The author can personally testify to
its accuracy in many details of the bloody history of New
Mexico. Mr. Siringo’s boyhood dates back into the Texas
that existed before the northern trails began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The author himself went to the Southwest in 1881; has
lived and traveled in the West all his life; and has followed
or crossed the old cattle trail at perhaps fifty points between
the Gulf and Northern boundary lines. The term of years
thus indicated covers many changes. The future will bring
yet swifter change. As to the great pastoral days of the
West, it is high time for a fiction that may claim to be
faithful and reverent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fiction cannot be exact, else it would be history and not
fiction. That it should fairly reflect the spirit of its chosen
day goes without saying. To lurid writers who never could
have known the West, the author has found himself unable
to contract any debt, but would make full acknowledgment
to all who have aided from a wider information or experience.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span><h1>CHAPTER VI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE LONE HERD</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>“A</span></span>ND I’ll bet this is the sorriest herd of cows
that ever was made on the soil of Texas!”
There was grief in the tones of old Jim
Nabours as he turned away from the dusty flat where
the circling riders were holding the main body of the
T. L. gathering. For many days the men had been
riding mesquite thicket, timbered flat and open glade,
sweeping in the cattle in a general rodeo for the making
of the trail herd. This was the result.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About one in ten of what we’d orto of had, and what
she still thinks she’s got,” he added, speaking to his
own trail segundo, bearded young Del Williams, as they
pulled up and looked back at the cattle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Williams nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s been a system,” said he. “Some one’s stripped
the whole upper range. We’d orto had fifty riders instead
of ten—and not a Mexican in the lot—to ride
the upper water fronts. I got my own suspicions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And me. But what’s the use? The war come and
we couldn’t help it. But even if cows wasn’t worth a
damn we ought to of knew how many we didn’t have.
Till now, I never really did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Williams nodded. A tall, well-favored youth he was,
with the gravity of the returned soldier. He still, fault
of better, wore the Confederate gray. His garb was
worn and patched, like that of the foreman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They robbed that range after the old man was
killed and afore we-all got here in charge. For over
two years Del Sol was let plumb alone. Laguna del
Sol! Best range in Texas, and the onliest place in all
Texas that ain’t boiling over with cows right now!
Fours? Long threes? Beeves? How could we pick?
We was lucky to get what we did, even with quite some
few that don’t show T. L. any too damned plain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, there’s over four thousand head,” Williams
went on; “four thousand three hundred and forty-two
is what we made it when we tallied ’em in. But sufferin’
snakes!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uh-huh. There’s steers there that looks like old
Colonel Cortés in the face—bet there’s a thousand head
that dates back beyond the Spanish Conquest. There’s
yearlings here is ten years old, and the rest perportionate.
Spring calves and fours and threes and laws knows
what—that’s one fine outfit to drive a thousand miles,
huh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Williams soberly, “we got to tell the
boss we just made it mixed, so’s’t she could suit every
buyer. And damned if I don’t think she could—unless’n
a buyer wanted a even lot of good fours for
beeves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” assented Nabours. “If only she wasn’t
so hard to fool and so sot in her ways!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is the new chute ready?” he asked, settling back
into the saddle as he uncoiled a leg from around the
horn. “We’ve got to get ’em in the road brand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The boys got the wings done this morning,” replied
Williams. “It won’t take forever to put our Fishhook
road brand over the T. L. But I’ll bet a horse there’s
mossy horns in there’ll brand as hard as a tarrypin, and
calves that’ll take two to hold the brand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a lesser flat, a couple of miles from the home
corrals, new corrals and a branding chute had hurriedly
been put up by the T. L. hands for the quicker process
of working the trail herd. The material was mesquite
posts set deep, with cross poles lashed on with hide. A
nail was a thing unknown. The two men rode along
the fenced lines approvingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The sher’f’s a cow hand, all right,” said Nabours.
“Just how he finds time to quit the sher’f’s office is
what he ain’t explained, no more’n a lot of other things.
But cows he does know. He’s coming in now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rider who approached them from the farther
side of the flat was not easily recognizable as the same
young man who had ridden alone into the Del Sol gate
a fortnight or more ago. His garb now was the loose
wool of the average cattle hand of the place and day, his
checkerboard trousers thrust into his bootlegs. Chaparajos
he did not now wear, nor did any Saxon Texans
when they could avoid it. There was at that time no
standardized cowboy, nor any uniform for him. Indeed,
the very name of “cowboy” was unknown on the lower
range. The Del Sol ranch hands were for the most part
sons of neighboring ranches, most of them lank, whiskered,
taciturn young men, and for the most part seedy
of apparel. They came in what garb they were able to
get, and they utterly lacked uniformity, beyond the fact
that each could ride, rope and brand, and all were able
to live on food that would have killed men less hardy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of such company might have been Dan McMasters
now as he plodded forward, mounted on a stout
<span class='it'>grulla</span> of his own string—a blue-crane horse such as
would sometimes be seen in any large remuda. He had
appeared at Del Sol a week earlier than he had promised,
but had forbidden the men to announce him at the
house. He had lived with the cattle hands, and wished
his presence to be unknown, he said, until after the herd
was on its way. All for reasons which he did not
declare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was taciturn and mysterious as ever to Jim
Nabours, and the latter also grew chary of speech. Low
as his own resources were, it did not wholly please him
that, stacked up in two newly arrived trail wagons near
the home corral, were supplies enough to run the outfit
through to Abilene. It pleased him no more that if
the Del Sol remuda now carried under its own road
brand another brand, that brand should be the McMasters
Circle Arrow, which was ranged in Gonzales
County, far below. Del Sol had never borrowed, never
been obliged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Amigos! Caballeros!</span>” McMasters waved a hand
as he drew near.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Del Williams looked at him in silence, nor was
Nabours at first much more communicative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” he said at length, “that there bunch of cows
is what we call our trail herd. I expect they’d all hold
still and let us brand ’em standing. The boss don’t suspect
nothing but what this here herd is all select fours.
Well, let her think so. Grass is up strong here, and
we’ll not ketch it as we move north. So let’s push this
here Noah’s-ark outfit into the pens and get it in the
Fishhook soon’s the Lord’ll let us!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we’ve all done our best,” commented McMasters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours looked at him dourly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ef we wasn’t broke,” said he, “you couldn’t of done
as much as I’ve let you. Anyhow I didn’t take all the
beans and molasses you sont up—there’s half in your
wagon yet, and I want you to send it back home. Besides,
I won’t take no wagon from you; we got our
own carts, and them’s good enough. Horses, now—why,
yes, I’ll take the loan of them, fer maybe you can
sell ’em north. I don’t want to hit Aberlene with a
bunch of sore backs. Ef you got some horses, anywheres,
why, there you are; but ef you’ve et up all the
chuck, why, where are you? We maybe couldn’t never
pay that back—I don’t know. So you jest send you
own wagon back home while you got it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, all right,” replied McMasters, slightly changing
color. “You know, of course, I’m not pushing anything
on you. I don’t want your employer to know
anything about it. And I know you-all have done your
best.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I reckon we have. We’re not hardly leaving a
hen wrangler at Del Sol—taking the whole force and
family and most of the furniture, down to Miss Taisie’s
trunk. Buck Talley, our Senegambian chief, he’d of
died if he hadn’t got to go on as cook. Milly can drive
one carreta, and old Anita don’t know nothing better’n
to set on the seat of a carreta and talk Spanish to them
oxens. Ef we don’t make Aberlene it’s because there
ain’t no Aberlene. Here we come, forty-five hundred
cows, ef ye don’t mind calling ’em that, sixteen more or
less human cow hands, nineteen kinds of rifles and six-shooters,
a hundred and fifteen saddle ponies and the
only red-headedest boss in all Texas, which is a girl.
God bless our home!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speaking of hair, did either of you-all ever notice
Miss Taisie’s sort of hair?” he demanded, suddenly
turning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McMasters made no comment. Del Williams only
looked at Nabours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you see, her hair is plumb long and plumb
straight, except at the far end it curls up, like a drake’s
tail. You see that? You know what that means?
Well, any woman that has hair like that can practice
magic. I read that in a dream book oncet. Them sort
is witches, and it’s no manner of use trying to stop ’em.
That’s what the book said. Living along twenty-two
year with Miss Taisie, taking out three I spent in the
war, I’m here to say the book didn’t tell no lie. So
here we all are, sixteen fools that can’t no ways help
theirselves, all along of the boss having that kind of
red hair that curls up on the end. Well, like you say,
we all done our best. I can’t look fifty horses and
two wagons of grub in the mouth—not yet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Del, ride back and tell the boys to throw the herd all
closter to the road chute. Let’s get as many as we can
in the iron before she gets too dark to work. We’ll put
half at roping and branding on the flat and the balance
can work ’em through the chute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three turned toward the dust cloud where the
main herd was held by the men. A rider was coming
out, top speed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello!” began Nabours. “What’s a-eating him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The horseman drew up his mount squatting, throwing
up a hand—old Sanchez, all his life a Del Sol rider,
and the only Mexican allowed to go with the trail herd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Pronto, Señor Jeem!</span>” he called. “<span class='it'>Los hombres—baja</span>!”
He pointed to the herd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What hombres, Sanchez? What’s up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Los hombres</span>—they cutta our herd!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cut our herd—what’s that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Read-a our brand—cutta our herd. They say-a we
gotta their <span class='it'>vacas</span>. They goin’ take!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cut our herd? On our own ground. Not none!
The man don’t live that’s going to cut a Del Sol herd
without my consent and my help. Come on!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He set spurs, rode through the thin fringe of mesquite
that made the shortest path.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, McMasters!” he called across his shoulder.
“I want you for witness here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as he and his two riders burst free and spurred
down the slope to where the great herd was made he
looked back, not hearing hoof beats. McMasters was
not with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be damned!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours smothered the remainder of a volley of hot-headed
oaths. He did not understand a man who sidestepped

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>N</span></span>ABOURS, Del Williams and old Sanchez
spurred down the saucerlike flat in which the
Del Sol herd was held. They arrived none too
soon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A party of six strangers, all armed, were engaged in
argument with as many of the Del Sol men, who had
ridden between them and the edge of the herd. The
plunging of the horses and the loud voices began to
make the wild cattle uneasy. Other riders were doing
all they could to hold the herd from a run, which might
have been precisely what the intruders desired. Their
leader, a heavy-set, dark-bearded, handsomely dressed
man, spurred out to meet Nabours, who came straight
in and with no ceremony jerked his mount almost
against him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who are you, and what do you want here?” he demanded
angrily. The stranger coolly turned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since you ride up and ask,” rejoined he, “we’re cowmen,
and we want our property.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re no cowman!” hotly retorted the old foreman.
“Else you wouldn’t be hollering and riding
around the aidge of another man’s herd. What you
trying to do—start our cattle back in the brush again?
Your property be damned! Get on away from the aidge
of our herd while you got time!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The numbers of the Del Sol riders, thus increased
and led by a determined man, impressed the brusque
stranger; but he did not lack assurance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You buck the law, friend?” said he. “I’ve got certified
records of eight brands, and powers of attorney
from the owners to comb any herd going off this range.
We’re taking no chances.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re taking damned long chances if you keep one
more minute where you’re at,” remarked Jim Nabours.
“Git back now, if you want to talk this over!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spurred between the strangers and the herd,
threw the weight of his horse against the nearest rider,
his eye never leaving the leader’s eye, and his hand
always ready. His men followed him, pushing straight
into the others. Any second a half dozen men might
have been killed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, boys!” called the bearded leader suddenly.
“Pull off till I tell this fellow what’s what.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They reined off, confused, a hundred yards or so one
side; but Nabours clung against his man, knee to knee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t tell us nothing!” said he. “You can’t cut
a critter out of this herd! You can’t look at ary brand
we got! You savvy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I savvy you’re running a right high blaze, neighbor.
You reckon you’re above the law?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damn the law! The law ain’t got in here yet. Ef it
had, our range wouldn’t of been skinned by a lot of lowdown
thieves that wasn’t above robbing a girl when her
own men was away. I’ve knowed all this year that our
range was skinned. What cows we got we need.
We’re a-going to trail ’em all north, jest like they lay,
and no outfit’s going to cut that herd, law or no law.
’Tain’t no cow thieves is going to work over a brand in
our herd, or even look at one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t hang that on me! Cow thieves?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do hang it on you, and it goes! You look like a
cow thief to me, and act like one. You come from Austin,
but you never was raised in Texas. Pull out or
we’ll work you over, and do it the old way!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two bands, about equal in numbers—for the bulk
of the Del Sol men dared not leave the held herd—now
faced each other, roughly divided by a line constantly
changing as the horses shifted and plunged. Every
man was armed. The insult had been passed. The smile
on Nabours’ lined face, showing his snarling white
teeth, the scowl on the face of the other partisan meant
now only maneuvering for the first break. None of the
stern-faced group thought of anything else. Eye
watched hand. Revolvers lay itching and corded nerves
were taut above them. Each man waited for the break.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thunder of hoofs coming down the slope at their
rear made a new factor. Jim Nabours dared not lift
an eye to see who or what it was. He had to watch the
other man’s eye, his hand. But the voice of old Sanchez
rose, calling to the newcomers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Pronto, capitan! Vien aqui, pronto! Pronto!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The intruders whirled, not daring to begin an encounter
with new assailants at their rear. The crisis
was broken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Nabours saw five men, splendidly armed and
mounted, who swept on, spurring. They wore the
riding-garb of the newly reorganized Texas Rangers,
that strange constabulary of the border soon to make
more history of their own. A beardless boy, apparently
their lieutenant, led them now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hands up, you men!” commanded he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The five men were halted in line, their perfectly
broken mounts steady. A repeating carbine of the new
Spencer type was in the hands of each, and each of the
five had a man covered, his rifle leveled from his own
waist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sanchez, throw their guns on the ground!” ordered
Nabours suddenly. The young lieutenant nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t move, any of you, or we’ll have to shoot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quietly he sat his motionless horse while the old
Mexican, dismounting, walked to each saddle of the
herd cutters and, drawing out each rifle, threw it and the
man’s pistols in a heap on the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does this mean?” demanded the burly leader
of the invaders, still blustering. “We’re here peaceable.
We’ve broke no law. We’re only after our own
property that these men are about to drive out of the
country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Back to Austin!” replied the armed youth tersely.
“If there’s a court left worth the name I’m going to get
justice for you some time, Mr. Rudabaugh.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What on earth do you mean by that?” rejoined the
ruffian. “We got papers to take up cows in these
brands. Looky here. Don’t you never think you can
hold up a state officer of Texas! I’ll have you damned
rangers disbanded!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” replied the youngster. “We ain’t disbanded
yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But look here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The leader produced from the long tin case at his
cantle a series of papers purporting to be brand descriptions
and authorizations. The impassive young lieutenant
shuffled them through, his rifle across his saddle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?” said he. “Brands? What brands? Gonzales
County? How old is the Six Slash E in Gonzales?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twelve years,” asserted the chief of the interlopers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a liar, Mister Treasurer,” smiled the boy.
“There isn’t and never was any such brand in Gonzales.
I think your names are forged. What are you doing in
here, so far south?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The partisan showed a sudden perturbation in his
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, who are you?” he demanded. “You seem to
know mighty much for a upstart. I tell you, I’ll have
you and your robbers all disbanded!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind! I just happened to meet up with these
other boys. You ride along as far as Austin and rest
your hat there a while. We’ll see what the court says,
if there are any courts now. You’ve worked this range
long enough and close enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The youth never lost his calm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll wish you’d never pulled this sort of play
with me!” flared Rudabaugh. “I’ve got friends——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, the state treasurer does have friends. Don’t
you steal enough that way, in your river-improvement
ring and your other deals, without coming away south
to rob a girl? What grudge you got against her or
against her family? I wouldn’t let you cut that herd if
I knowed it was full of brands besides the T. L.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re getting out of your depth now, young fellow,”
sneered Rudabaugh. “What’s more, this is Caldwell
and not Gonzales. You got no right to arrest anybody
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As a state Ranger I shore have. I’m nastier to run
on than any carpetbag sheriff that tallies in at Austin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take them in, boys,” he concluded. “Work the old
<span class='it'>ley fuga</span> if they break—but they’re damned cowards
and will go quiet. Just make them ride in front.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the horse!” he added to one of his men as
he rode apart and looked down on the dusty ground.
“Shoe off, right front, and hoof split. They was plumb
up to the gate of Del Sol.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and we’ll get our cows yet,” exclaimed Rudabaugh
savagely, as a ranger nodded to old Sanchez, who
now deftly bound each man’s feet together under his
horse’s belly with a Spanish knot that bid fair to stay
set.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So?” The young rider’s smile was pleasant.
“Now, how’d you all like to have back your guns and
an even break, you to begin right now to cut that Del
Sol herd?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know there’s cows in that herd that ain’t in the
T. L. Brand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, they’ll all be in our road brand before sundown
two days,” cut in Jim Nabours now. “You lying,
low-down dog, I wish to God these boys hadn’t came!
There’s only one way to handle people like you. Git
out of jail—and come back! That’s all we hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“McCullough, do you want any more men?” he
added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” The youth laughed and rode away. “Fall
in there, prisoners!” he commanded. “Ride for the
ferry trail. I wouldn’t try to ride too fast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, we’ll be back!” called the gang captain, defiant
still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I certainly do hope you will!” replied Nabours fervently.
“I’ll come all the way back from Aberlene, ef
I ever get there, just to be around here when you-all do
come!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A chorus of jeers and curses came back from the
prisoners. The Rangers said never a word, but herded
their men on ahead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim Nabours jerked up his mount—a sign to the
herd riders, and the latter swung away, glad enough to
have the herd still under control. The animals began
to edge out, to thin, to spread, to graze. Old Jim
Nabours rode to the edge, singing a song of his own, as
he sometimes did when especially wrathful:</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>“C</span></span>USS take the law!” fumed old Jim Nabours.
“I never seen nothing but trouble come out of
law. Ef it wouldn’t of been for them Ranger
boys we’d of killed Rudabaugh and his outfit right here,
and that’d of ended the whole business. Courts? They
own the courts; they’ll all be out and at it again inside
a week. Ef they meet up with us again I shore hope
there won’t be no Rangers. When come it a cowman
can’t take care of his own cows?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But come on, now, Del, push ’em over to the new
pens; we got to work this Noah’s ark right now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours and Dell Williams slowly edged out a string
of cattle, making a point. Swing men rode gently
somewhat farther back; others pushed in the stragglers.
Quietly, efficiently, with the long skill of men who all
their lives had “savvied cows,” they broke the compact
mass into a long-strung-out line, traveling quietly in
the direction laid out by the leaders. The herd submitted
itself to guidance. All went well until they
reached the raw new lines of the crude branding chute,
when a few of the old mossy horns began to stare and
then to roll their tails as though about to break away;
but trouble finally was averted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The swing men crowded and cut the front of the
herd to one side of the others. Back of them others
began to circle the long procession. In a few moments
two herds were made on the flat near the branding pens.
In half an hour three irons of the Fishhook road brand,
made by Buck the cook, were getting cherry heat in the
fire near the chute. Men pushed a thin line of animals
out of the smaller bunch, heading them for the fences.
Once in the wings, they were crowded into the V till
a row of a dozen or twenty stood in single file back of
the rising gate. Then, amid swaying that strained the
rawhide lashings of the new fence, and to the chorus
of bawls of the creatures as the hot irons sizzled into
their hides, the Fishhook began to appear above the
T. L. holding and owner’s brand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tally one T. L. four! Two T. L. four! One T. L.
yearling! One T. L. yearling! One T. L. two!” Sometimes
a man would grin as he came back to the fire.
“This here T. L. is the only thing I kin see on ary cow
so fur!” quoth Len Hersey, top hand. “Ef it wasn’t
put on right good we kin fix it some with a runnin’ iron.
Keep about two straights in the fire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tally one three!” came a voice. “Say, Del, this
here Fishhook is the plumb catchin’est road brand ary
feller ever did see! Does my eyes deceive me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Laughter and jests, dust, noise, lowings and groanings,
the clack and clatter of cattle moved into the
wings, the smell of the herd blending with the odor of
singed hair—all the old-time flavor of cattle work in
the open—went on now, the thin wedge of tail-twisting,
surly brutes pushed out of the chute gate increasing
steadily. The nucleus of the Del Sol trail herd grew
steadily, until finally the red sun fell below the distant
screen of the live-oak groves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She pops!” said Del Williams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shore she pops!” assented Nabours. “We’ll get
the boss up a herd if we have to make ’em out of red
dirt, way God made old Uncle Adam!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello!” he added. “There’s the boss a-coming!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Indeed, through the dust, wind-carried up the flat,
there showed the white feet and front of Blancocito.
Taisie Lockhart, again in her range clothing, stained
and worn, her hair once more clubbed between her
shoulders with a shoe string, rode up soberly, trotting
close to the pens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How are you, Jim?” said she. “How are you all,
men? Where’ve you been three days back?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim Nabours wiped his face on the dirty kerchief
he pulled around his neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where we been, Miss Taisie?” he answered. “Why,
we been strolling around with our light geetars amid the
cactus, a-rounding up the finest road herd ever put
up in Texas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Jim, we said maybe beeves—fours or long
threes! Look yonder in the chute, man! There’s two
fours, that’s all! The rest are twos and calves!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m Noah, ma’am,” said Jim Nabours gravely.
“This here, now, is my ark. Don’t you come horning
in. Of course, ef we do got a lot of she-stuff and mixed
ages along of the others, how could we help it? Reckon
it’s cheaper to iron ’em when you got ’em, ain’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you’re ironing everything, and all in the road
brand, calves and all!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ma’am,” said Jim Nabours solemnly, “ef we wasn’t
short of hands I’d shore fire the segundo, Del Williams.
He’s the onthoughtedest man I ever did see. Now look
what he done, him being in a dream! I expect he done
run our iron on a dozen or so that ain’t beeves a-tall!
And it won’t come off in the wash! Now, how can we
get it off? Miss Taisie, as the daughter of the best
cowman Texas ever seen, what would you segest fer
me to do with Del?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl turned aside to hide a smile that made her
cheek dimple.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ve got a pair of eyes,” said she.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shore you have, Miss Taisie, and fine ones, too.
I wish they was different. But any good cowman has
got to have two kinds of a eye—one to tell a brand fur
as he can see a critter and t’other not to see no brand
that he don’t want to see. Now you go on back to the
house, Miss Taisie, and leave us alone, and we’ll turn
in up to Aberlene, ef there is ary such place, with the
damnedest, evenest, finest bunch of beeves you ever
seen, every one in the T. L. and Fishhook, and all of ’em
yores. God bless our home!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He flicked at the white stripe on Blancocito’s hips
with the end of his own bridle rein; whereat Blancocito
sprang a dozen feet to one side—but Taisie with him,
not at all concerned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t, Jim,” she protested. “You always treat me
like a child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, ain’t you?” replied Jim. “Shore you’ll be the
richest child in Texas six months from now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl reined over to where her faithful adjutant
stood, led him one side. Her face was troubled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jim——” she began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, ma’am?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jim, what’s wrong around Del Sol? Something’s
wrong!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, Miss Taisie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drew yet closer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some one’s been around the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What? What’s that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some one’s been in the house! I don’t know just
when. You know my little old trunk—I mean the
Spanish-leather box with the big hinges?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, yes, ma’am. I seen it a hundred times in the
front room—seen it just the other day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was in the front room. It isn’t there now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What? What you telling me, Miss Taisie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s gone! I missed it to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What all was in it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some things of my mother’s; laces, you know, a
silver comb, pictures—and some clothes. That’s almost
all, except a lot of old papers. There were bundles and
bundles of my father’s old land scrip. He was always
buying it, as you know; no one could stop him. He said
it would be worth something some day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Taisie, he said right! He told me that land
would be worth five dollars a acre in Texas some day;
maybe even ten. He said a beef four’d bring twelve
dollars here on the Texas range. He said he was going
to buy land, all he could get, at five cents a acre, while
he could. And he’d of got a heap more in his pasture
if he’d lived. And his trunk of scrip——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By my mother’s grave!”—the girl rose to her full
height in her stirrups, in a sudden tempest of wrath, her
right hand high above her head—“I swear I’ll make the
drive for him—and her! I swear if I ever find the thief
that came in my house I’ll live for my family’s revenge,
and for that alone!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jim, they’re robbing us! I know that herd! Do
you think I’m blind! Don’t I know cows? Yon’s the
leavings, the trimmings, of the Del Sol range! All
right! We’ll drive the leavings. My word and my
life for it, I’ll be only a man now till all these things are
squared! Will you stand by me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ort’n to ask, Miss Taisie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jim, now listen! I want every corner of the bunk
house searched, every tent, every wagon, every jacal,
before we start north. If we find the box we’ll know
what to do.”</p>

filaments, insentient, antenatal—Texas, not having
an identity, not yet born, but soon to be a
world. What a world! How rich a world!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above, for two thousand miles, nigh a thousand
miles right-angled across the needle’s path, swept another
unknown world, the Great West of America,
marked till now only by big-game trails and pony paths
and wagon tracks. The road to Oregon was by then
won. The iron rails that very year bound California
to the Union. But nothing bound Texas to the Union.
Unknown, discredited, aloof, a measureless wilderness
herself, she did not know of the wilderness above her,
and until now had cared nothing for it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this central part of the great, varied state the
grasses grew tall, the undergrowth along the streams
was rank. The live oaks were gigantic, standing sometimes
in great groves, always hung with gray Spanish
moss. Among and beyond these lay vast glades, prairies,
unfenced pastures for countless game and countless
cows. It was a land of sunshine and of plenty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A cool haze, almost a mist, lay before dawn on the
prairie lands. Now, when morning came on the Del Sol
range, a sea of wide horns moved above the tall grass.
With comfortable groans the bedded herd arose one by
one, in groups, by scores and hundreds, stretching backs
and tails. The night riders ceased their circles, the
cattle began to spread out slowly, away from the bed
ground, a little eminence covered with good dry grass
and free of hillocks, holes and stones, chosen by men
who knew the natural preferences of kine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A clatter of hoofs came as the young night herd—the
boy Cinquo Centavos, vastly proud of his late promotion—drove
up his remuda to the rope corral. A blue
smoke rose where the cook pushed mesquite brands together
again. It was morning on the range. Aye, and
it was morning of a new, great day for unknown Texas
and the unknown West that lay waiting far above her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two great trails—that running east and west,
that running north and south—now were about to
approach and to meet at a great crossroads, the greatest
and most epochal crossroads the world has even seen.
Here was the vague beginning of a road soon to be
bold and plain; almost as soon to be forgotten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slow and tousled, men and boys kicked out of the
cotton quilts which had made their scant covering, each
taking from under his saddle pillow the heavy gun and
such hat as he had. Few had need to hunt for boots,
for most had slept in them. Bearded, hard, rude, unbrushed,
they made a wild group when they stumped
up to the morning fire, where each squatted on one knee
while using tin cup and tin plate. Cutlery was scanty,
but each man had some sort of knife. Sugar there was
none, but a heavy black molasses did for sweetening to
the coffee, which itself largely was made of parched
grain. A vessel of great red beans had been hidden
in the hot ashes overnight; there was plenty of bacon
aswim in the pans for spearing; and of corn pones,
baked before the fire, many lay about. Of this
provender Buck, the negro cook, made them all free by
his call to “Come an’ git it!” Of the regular chuck
wagon of the well-appointed later trail outfits, of the
rough but better abundance, there was no more than
faint prophecy here in the rude high-wheeled Mexican
cart. In truth, the Del Sol outfit was poor, bitterly poor.
Here was a <span class='it'>noli-me-tangere</span> assembly of truculent men
whose adventure into unknown lands bordered close
upon the desperate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the later accepted costume of the trail and range,
there was no more than indication. The hats were a
dozen sorts for a dozen men. The neck scarf of each
man above his collarless tow shirt was a scanty plain
red bandanna, for use, not show. Spurs, saddles,
bridles, boots—these things were good, for the Spanish
influence lingered in Texas a generation after the
“dead body of Coahuila” had been shaken off. The saddles
were heavy and broad of horn, each with double
cinches. The stirrups were without exception covered
with heavy tapaderos. The reata at each horn was
thin, of hide close braided, pliable, tough as steel. Of
chaparajos, or leggings, as these men always called
them, perhaps a half dozen pairs were owned by older
men; the young could not afford them. Now, freed of
the necessity of riding chaparral in the round-up of the
herd, the leggings were cast into the cook wagon along
with the ragged bed rolls. So now they stood or kneeled
or squatted, coatless, collarless, unbrushed, belted and
booted, without exception thin, almost without exception
tall, each with his white-and-black checkered pants
in his boots, his garb light, insufficient, meager. They
were poor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But of good weaponry these men of the border were
covetous. The older men had each a pair of the army
Colts—cap and ball, for fixed ammunition was not yet
on the range. His pistol flask, his little cleaning rod,
his bag of round balls, each man guarded with more
care than his less weight of coin. The rifles were nondescript
as the men themselves. One man had a revolving
Colt rifle, a relic of the New Mexican expedition of
’42. Of the new Henry rifles, repeaters, many had
found their way thus far south; and of the heavy
Sharpe rifles, such as were used by Berdan’s sharpshooter
corps in the Civil War—with the great Minié
ball and its parchment cartridge and the lever breech
action—a half dozen survived. Most prized by some,
execrated by others, were the Spencer repeating carbines,
throwing their heavy ball with at least approximate
accuracy if one could guess the distance of the
shot. The Yager and the Kentucky rifle, which won
Texas, now had disappeared. The first trail men had
yet to wait seven years before the Winchester and the
Frontier Colt ushered in the general day of fixed ammunition.
The first wild cavalcades of the Texas trail
certainly were unstandardized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the Del Sol men, all alike were silent now. Jim
Nabours, a long leg bent up, knelt over his plate on the
ground. Del Williams, bearded, young, comely, sat on
a cart tongue. Sanchez, old and gray, was under the
cart itself. Cinquo Centavos, name and family unknown,
called Sinker by his fellows, slim, eager, boyish,
stood as he ate, shivering in his cottons. A reticent,
ragged, grim, unprepossessing band they made, ill
matched and wild as the diverse cattle which now began
to edge out from their bed ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours, shutting his jackknife and putting it in his
pocket, paused as he saw a man ride out from the cover
of the mesquite. He knew him—McMasters, who had
not been seen since the affair of the Rudabaugh herd
cutters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huh! There’s Gonzales at last! He’s powerful
searchy about his work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McMasters came in, the last at the fire, and was
hardly welcomed. About him hung still the indefinable
difference that set him apart from these whose lives
were spent in the saddle, and this now had grown intensified.
He was dressed as they were, but his garments
fitted better, he was neater, trimmer. His
eye, gray and narrow, was calm, his tongue silent as
ever. A slow ease, deliberate, unhurrying, unwasting,
marked his movements. Still he seemed with them, not
of them, and they held their peace of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ask your pardon,” he said at length to Nabours,
“but you see, I’m a cow hand and a sheriff both. I had
a little business overnight. I’m ready to make a hand
now if I can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we’re ready to pull out,” replied the foreman.
“Del, didn’t Sanchez tell you the two carts was ready?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Si Señor</span>,” nodded his segundo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Old Milly went to bed in hern last night, to get a
good start, she said,” volunteered Len Hersey. “She
taken her old Long Tom musket to bed with her. You
see, enduring the war, Milly’s husband, Tom, he done
jine a Yankee nigger regiment and never did come back
home a-tall. That’s how come Milly to go north—she’s
lookin’ fer Tom. ‘Ef Ah ever kotch sight’n dat nigger,’
says she, ‘Ah sho gwine blow out his lights fer him.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, don’t let Milly talk war too much, so’s to spoil
her cooking for the boss,” said Nabours. “They’ll
make a separate camp. Put Anita on Miss Taisie’s
cart, for when she gets tired of the saddle Milly can
ride in the cook cart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is Miss Lockhart really going?” asked Dan McMasters
suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She shore is going. I told her to pull out late in
the morning from the big house and follow our trail.
Lord help the girl! There ain’t no woman belongs on
a fool trip like this here one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Move ’em out, boys,” said he at length, quietly. “Mr.
McMasters, I want you on point, with Del Williams.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so, unemotionally, there began one of the wildest
and strangest journeys ever made in any land.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Under the ancient art of handling cattle, known to
each of these men, the herd began slowly to move.
McMasters and Del Williams, a couple of hundred
yards apart, gently threaded out the farther edge of the
loosely grazing cattle, along whose flanks a dozen hands
sat loose in saddle, ready to take their appointed places
on swing and drag. A few old steers, rangy, tall, wild,
sunburned, trotted out ahead—the natural vanguard,
pacemaking, electing itself then and there, and holding
place for a thousand miles. The point almost formed
itself, as should be; for the art of trailing cattle was to
use their instincts, not to alter them; to follow them
and not to crowd them; to let them feed and travel, and
never to take a back track on the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gently, intoning a comfortable bar or so now and
then, the swing men spread and gently pushed additional
numbers back of the front wedge. The column
began to form, to stretch, loose, indefinite, not close
packed, stopping, hurrying, turning to look back, lowing,
no set purpose having yet been developed in the
vast band. A pair of swing men, no more, must serve
to control each three or four hundred head of cattle on
the march.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rangy vanguard were kept moving out, heading
north, still on their own native range. Soon they struck
a steady walk, in which they were encouraged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Roll along, little dogies! Roll along, roll along!”
chanted Len Hersey, on the head swing, as the great
motley herd got form.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Far at the back came the unhappy drivers of the drag—the
old, the maimed, the halt and the blind, steers
bowed down with weight of woe. Here were gaunt
cows, heavy with young, calves newborn trotting with
their dams, all in a vast pastoral hegira.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Young Cinquo Centavos, hustling his caballada together,
wailed in a high thin treble. “Neeter, Neeter,
Wah-a-hah-neeter, ast thy-y-y so-o-oul ef we mus’
part!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Came shufflng of hoofs, crack and creak of joints,
rattling of wide horns not yet shaken down into good
spacing in the march. At times the great remuda, a
hundred and fifty head of saddle stock, would thunder
off in a brief side break, and Cinquo must cease in his
appeal to Juanita. Forsooth, to his young soul Juanita
was a tall maid, of red hair that curled up only at the
ends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In less than an hour after they first moved, the lone
herd of Del Sol was made and trailed. Sinuous among
the tall grasses, it rolled out and on, northbound. It
made a vast historic picture, in a vast forgotten day;
a day when a new world was made and peopled overnight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim Nabours rode ahead of the herd as general guide
and forelooper. From his place, a half mile in advance,
he turned back in his saddle, looking at the long cloud
of dust; the rolling sea of backs, the pale swing of wide
horns above. His fierce soul exulted at the sight. He
shut his teeth, his eyes gleaming, as he faced north and
settled down into a plodding walk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ten in the morning, and the last of Del Sol’s drag,
little calves and all, misfits, ignorant mistakes and all,
had rabbled off and away, sore under the fly-bitten road
brand fresh on every hide. The dust cloud was hours
old at the upper edge of the flat, when at the opposite
edge, on the rim that divided the flat and the big house
of Del Sol, another and lesser dust cloud appeared over
the broken turf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was made by two rude two-wheeled carts, each
drawn by a double span of oxen. The roughly spoked
wheels, stiffened by slats lashed on with rawhide thongs,
emitted shrieking protest at each revolution on the axle.
Each carreta had a tilt of canvas stretched above its
rough bows, and each had certain cargo. On the front
seat of the first vehicle sat old Anita, brown and gray
and wrinkled. The rear cart was handled by a vast
negro woman with a long musket at her side—Milly, as
usual grumbling to herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These two women, old beyond love and life, doggedly
loyal, passionately affectionate, made the bodyguard of
Anastasie Lockhart, educated and dead-broke orphan,
setting out into the world at twenty-two on one of the
most impossible adventures any woman ever knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just now Anastasie Lockhart, trousered, booted,
gloved and hatted like some slim, curiously eye-arresting
young man, rode alone on her crossbar, Blancocito.
Her mass of heavy hair was down her back, burned
tawnier beyond the shade of the sombrero. Her eye
moody, she gazed on ahead at the procession that held
every friend she had on earth and every dollar that she
owned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She dropped back and rode alongside the leading cart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anita,” she said, “if I only had my stolen trunk,
I’d not be leaving a single thing on earth behind me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anita vouchsafed nothing for a time. She understood
English.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tronk?” said she presently. “What-a tronk,
<span class='it'>señorita</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The one that was stolen from my parlor—you know
very well what one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That-a-tronk? He is not stole. He’s back. I setta
on heem now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What? What’s that, Anita?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Si, Seguro.</span> I gotta heem under seat, serape on top.
Sanchez, my man, he bring. Las’ night he got heem
back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The lost trunk? Where? Where did he find it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sanchez, he look in waggone, he look in corral. In
one waggone, come from Gonzales, he find-a thees-a
tronk. Sanchez, he tak-a heem and put-a heem in here.
You like-a heem, dose tronk?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hand of Anastasie Lockhart fell lax at her
saddle horn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anita, tell me, was it in his wagon—Mr. McMasters’,
the Gonzales wagon that went back yesterday?
Was it in the wagon of Señor McMasters, the sheriff
of Gonzales?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Oh, si!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” A long sighing breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Vamenos!</span>” exclaimed Anastasie Lockhart after a
long time. She looked straight forward, not turning,
as one who left a used-out world behind.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>“W</span></span>E got ’em going!” called Jim Nabours, riding
back to his men. “Keep ’em moving!
Push ’em hard for the first day, so’s they’ll
be tired and sleep good. Look at them long shanks
walk! I’ll bet that old dun coaster that’s done elected
hisself head leader has got horns six feet acrost, and
ef he’s ten year old he’s a hunderd. Well, anyhow, he’s
on his way north. <span class='it'>And-a-lay</span>, old Alamo!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He knows about as much where he’s going as we
do,” said Del Williams, whom he had addressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shore he does, and more. I come from Uvalde,
where it’s plumb wild. I was raised on squirrel and
corn pone, and all the learning I got was out the little
old blue-back speller. But my pap done told me that
since Texas taken most of the earth away from Mayheeco,
Uncle Sam, he’s had about six government surveys
made a-trying and a-trying to find whereat is
the one hundredth meridian, and likewise how far north
is 36-30, so’s they can tell where Texas stops at. They
can’t not one of them people agree even with hisself
where either of them places is at. Them surveyors
don’t know no more’n that claybank steer. Trail?
There ain’t no trail. We’re lost from the first jump,
unless’n that steer knows. There wasn’t never no
Chisholm Trail nowheres, and I can whip any man says
there was. I didn’t read of no such thing in the blue-back
speller. But I allow, give me a good North Star
and a dun steer, I kin find Aberlene ef there is ary such
place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, we’ll find a trail,” replied the younger man.
“I’m telling you, there is a trace called the Chisholm
Trail north of the Red River. You can get to Baxter
Springs that way, or to Little Rock, and I reckon to
Wichita; and Aberlene’s north of Wichita somewheres.
There’s grass and water all the way through.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All trails is alike to a cow man,” assented Nabours.
“My pap said all trails was begun by horse thiefs. My
pap come west into Texas from Louisianny. He come
over the Trammel Trace, from the prairies west.
Injuns made that, but it didn’t get nowheres. Injuns,
horse thiefs, whisky peddlers—I reckon that’s about
how the cow trails started. What they call the Chisholm
Trail runs up to the Arbuckle Mountains. That’s where
we’ll hit the reservation Indians. They’ll all want
beef—and whisky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a road up from Santone to San Marcos
and Austin, so I reckon we’ll head up Plum Creek and
strike in north over Cedar and Onion. Ef there is a
trail we’ll find it. Ef there ain’t we’ll make one. Foller
that dun steer—he knows where Aberlene is at.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wheeling and riding far at one side of the scattered
herd, the foreman rode to the rear, where the cows and
calves were straggling on. His drag on that side met
him—Sid Collins, flap-hatted, tobacco-stained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Corporal,” said he, “we got more cows now’n what
we had at breakfast. They’d ought to be riding mostly
on a rawhide under the cook wagon, but that nigger
says if we put ary ’nother calf in his cart he’s gwine fer
to quit right now. Milly’s so big she fill up the hull
carreter; and besides, old Sanchez and Aniter has got
it plumb full of chickens.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Calfs, huh? Well, now, that somehow hadn’t seem
to come to my mind none, about calfs. How many new
ones you got?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Six. Not big enough to brand, but big enough to
bawl. An’ we got six cows on the prod, follerin’ the
cook cart, so’s the cook he’s afraid to git offen the seat.
Ef this here now keep up, we’ll have half the herd in
the cook cart and the other half follerin’, lookin’ for
war. I most hatter shoot one cow right now. We got
to hold the remuda way back. Miss Taisie’s behind
that, even, with the other cart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell Miss Taisie to ride front, where she belongs
on her own cows, son.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I segest that, but she won’t,” said the troubled cow
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does she know who’s riding point?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shore! I told her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And she wouldn’t come?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours shut his lips grimly; then, as usual when in
trouble, broke out into song: “Oh, granny, will yore
dog bite, dog bite, dog bite? Granny, will yore dog
bite, dog bite me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leave me shoot all them calfs, Mr. Nabours,” urged
Sid Collins. “They kain’t walk, an’ they ain’t wuth a
damn. Then the cows’d behave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s what we shore orto do,” agreed Nabours.
“They hold up the herd. But we need every critter we
got. Maybe we’ll find somebody to trade ’em to fer
something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t we cut back all the she-stuff an’ on’y
drive steers, Mr. Jim?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because ef we left a cow or a calf on Del Sol this
spring, by fall neither’d be on our range. As well as
clean it and let it take a chance as have thieves do it for
us. No, ef our calfs die, I’m going to die ’em as fur
north as I can. Yes, and ef ary one of ’em dies I’m
going to run the T. L. iron on him after he dies—and,
yes, the Fishhook road brand over that—so’s’t the
buzzards’ll know whose stock they’re a-eating of! My
good Lord! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh, granny, will yore dog bite, dog
bite——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rode on back, through the thinning dust. The
two carts were still a mile behind. He could see the
white-band horse ridden by the mistress of Del Sol.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were sixteen men on the T. L. herd. Sixteen
loved Taisie Lockhart in sixteen ways, save for the one
element of fiercely reverent loyalty. This grizzled old
foreman loved her as his child. His brows narrowed,
his grim mouth shut tight under the graying beard as
he approached the slender figure which came on, facing
her great road into the unknown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Push on up, Miss Taisie,” called Nabours. “Yore
place is at the head. We’ll see nothing hurts ye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to ride front,” replied the girl. “You’ve
got men enough there. Who’s riding point besides
Del?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Dan McMasters is on left point, Miss Lockhart,”
said Jim Nabours quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he’s been over the road north, anyways—the
onliest one of us has. He’s a cowman. So fur, I taken
him fer a square man. Not that I care a damn fer a
hand’s morerls. He may be a horse thief, but jest so
he don’t steal from us I don’t care.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suppose a hand did steal from us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never did hear of no such thing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jim, listen! I’ve found my trunk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! Where at?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sanchez found it in the—well, the McMasters
wagon that went back to Gonzales this morning.
We’ve got it in our cart now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours looked far out over the gray and green of
the landscape a long time before he ventured speech.
His face then was sad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve knowed men shot for less,” said he at length.
“But are you sure? Do you know who done it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t seen anything. I only know what Sanchez
says. None of my men stole the trunk. It meant
nothing to them. The land scrip in it might some day
mean a fortune to a man who did know about such
things; and he did know it was there; and he did say
that there’d be a boom in land and cows in Texas in less
than ten years, maybe five.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we Lockharts always did open our doors.
We thought the world was honest!—It’s hard for me
to doubt—to doubt—him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Downcast, she rode on. It was long before Nabours
made comment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Taisie,” said he at last, “there can’t no man
rob you and get away with it. Us men won’t have it.
After supper I’ll be back at yore camp. I’ll have with
me my left-point man. I’ll have besides my segundo
and Sanchez and six of the best hands of Del Sol.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean to do, Jim?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mean to do? You ast that, and you a cowman,
and daughter of one? I mean to hold a court, that’s
what I mean to do. What us fellows decides is right
is what’ll happen. It’ll happen soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Jim”—the girl was suddenly pale—“we’d have
to take any—any suspected man to Austin. And he’s
a sheriff himself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Austin be damned, ma’am! Likewise, sher’f be
damned! Del Sol runs her own laws. That man’s
father and yores was friends—until the war. Then
they wasn’t so much, maybe. Calvin McMasters was
a Yankee sympathizer. We don’t know it wasn’t him
that killed yore father. But there can’t no man rob
Burleson Lockhart’s girl and get by with it!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll try him fair,” he added. “I’d never of believed
it. This shore does hurt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It hurts, Jim. He was our visitor. Did he eat—with
you boys?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He shore et. We taken him in. He done broke
the one law of this country.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span><h1>CHAPTER XI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE COURT ON THE TRAIL</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>T</span></span>HE sun swung low. Nabours rode back, addressing
his point men impersonally. “We bed
on the slope, yon. Let ’em water full.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the cattle quenched their thirst the men quietly
pressed them to the left of the route, urging them one
side, blocking further progress. The half-wild cattle
seemed to know that here, on high, smooth ground,
breeze-swept and dry, with good mattress not only of
new but old grass, they could get a good night’s lodging.
They grazed, slowed down, and the men held them till
they should bed down for sleep. Over four thousand
cattle, of all ages—too large and too mixed a body for
good trailing—now were by way of forming good trail
habits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Nabours left the herd and spoke a time with Del
Williams, five other men of his oldest. Together they
rode to where Dan McMasters sat his horse, idly watching
the cattle in the cool of evening. They rode so
silently, so grimly, that a shadow of menace must have
lain before them. Without a word the tall, slender
figure whirled his horse to front them. Like a rattler,
he always was on guard. His elbows nearly level with
his hips, his two hands touched his guns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, gentlemen?” McMasters spoke quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better drop the guns,” said Nabours, also unagitated.
“There’s six of us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s twelve of me,” said Dan McMasters evenly.
“You wanted me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Drop yore guns on the ground.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t any of you make a move,” was the other’s
reply to this. “I don’t know what you mean.” Both
guns were out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We came to arrest you, for trial, to-night, now.
That’s my duty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nabours,” said McMasters, slowly, at last, “I ought
to kill you for that. But I’ve got to have this clear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give up your guns and stand fair trial. We’ll make
it clear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No man lives who shall touch my guns. But who
brings charge against Dan McMasters, sheriff and ranger
and deputy marshal of the United States? What
sort of mean joke is this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s Miss Taisie Lockhart brings the charge,” said
Nabours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man flinched as though struck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What charge?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Theft; stealing from a friend; stealing from folks
that has fed you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly the black muzzles drooped. With a movement
as deliberate as their withdrawal had been swift, McMasters
thrust both guns into their scabbards, unbuckled
his belt and hung it over his saddle horn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has she sent for me?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll come.” McMasters spoke as though with difficulty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours pointed to a little fire whose smoke arose
at the edge of a clump of cover a quarter of a mile
away; a small tent, two white-topped carts making an
individual encampment, apart from the trail cook’s
mess. Without a word the accused man, his head
slightly dropped forward, rode toward the fire, both
hands on the pommel of his saddle, looking neither
to the right nor to the left.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anastasie Lockhart came from her little tent at the
call of Nabours. Her hands suddenly were clasped
at her throat as she saw the tall figure among these
other stern-faced men. It was too late for her now to
reason, to withdraw her charge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We brung in the man,” announced Nabours. “You
are the judge. We’ll hear what he has to say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A strange, inscrutable quality was one of the singular
characteristics of Dan McMasters. His face was a
coldly serene mask now as he stood beside his horse,
looking straight at the tall girl who stood, woman in
spite of her man’s garb, her men’s surroundings. If
any emotion could be traced on his face it was a shade
of pity, of great patience. Concern for his personal
safety seemed not to be in his mind. This indifference
to danger, this calm, did not lack effect. The men who
guarded him suddenly wished they were well out of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I a judge? No! I’ve nothing to say,” Taisie
choked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you have had something to say, and you done
said it to me,” rejoined Nabours. “You started something
and you got to go through with it. Set down
there on that bed roll. You got to tell us all what you
told me. As owner of this herd, you’re the main judge.
There can’t nobody shirk no right and no duty here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Set down here, prisoner. It seems to me you’d
orto give up your weapons to the court.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll give Miss Lockhart anything on earth but my
guns,” said McMasters evenly. “No one touches them
but me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon no man here is scared to do what he’s got
to do,” remarked Nabours simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McMasters made no reply. He never had a hand far
from his revolvers. He seated himself now so that he
could face all his accusers, flat on the ground. His
buckled pistol belt lay over one leg. An exact observer
must have noted that the toe of one boot rested inside
the farther end of the buckled belt, so that proper
resistance would be offered in case their owner should
snatch at the butts of the heavy guns, both of which
were turned ready for convenient grasp. So he sat,
facing the jury, facing his Portia—facing what was
a far worse thing than death itself to any man of honor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were a jury of his peers, as nearly as might be,
though he had had no hand in their selection. Had he
known all the histories of these men he might have
challenged for cause Del Williams, trail segundo, who
rode right point. He had heard a man or two pass a
rude joke or so, although he did not know that as Del
Sol ranch hand Del Williams, ten years her senior,
had known Burleson Lockhart’s daughter from her
infancy. The way of Del Williams’ love was silence
and reverence. But Del Williams was of some chivalric
strain. That now was to be proved. That his most
dangerous rival was this prisoner he knew perfectly
well by the primal instincts of man; and now came a
certain test.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Del,” began Nabours, turning to his lieutenant as
next in authority, “tell us what you know about this
man since he come to our house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know anything at all,” answered Williams
slowly. “Ef I did I wouldn’t tell it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His thin, brown-bearded face was set in quiet resolution.
Talebearer he would not be. His fellows looked
at him stolidly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ma’am,” went on the prosecutor, “you told me
yore trunk was stole out of yore parlor. It had papers
in it—land scrip, God knows how many sections.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I missed the trunk.” Taisie was very pale,
her voice a whisper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Dan McMasters, did you ever see that trunk?
I hate to ask you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes; I did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was in it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. It was open, close to me, where I
sat in the parlor. I saw some lace, some women’s
gloves, or mitts. I didn’t look again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you see it after that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where was it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Near the gate—outside the gate, in the edge of the
brush. I thought it odd it should be there. I was
sure I’d seen it up at the house, the only time I was in
the house. You were there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shore I was! She said all her father’s land scrip
was in that box; we all said it’d be worth money some
day to any cowman. You heard it. You knowed where
the trunk was and what was in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; so did you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why did you put it in your wagon that was
going back to Gonzales.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not. That is either a mistake or a lie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it was there. Sanchez found it there. He
taken it and put it in Anita’s carreta. It’s there now.
We declare that to you. It was missing from the house.
It was found in yore wagon. Yore wagon was going
back home. That was right where some men was laying
up in the brush when you left. You didn’t let me
foller them. You didn’t show up when them same men—we
proved by the split-hoof track—was trying to cut
our herd. Only the Rangers saved that. Ef you’re
a Ranger, why wasn’t you there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll not have any man ask me such questions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t tell us what you’ll have or won’t have. You’ll
have what we give you, no more, no less. Explain how
come that trunk in your wagon. Not a man on Del Sol
except you and me knowed what was in it or where it
was. Now who done put it in yore wagon? It looked
right easy to sneak that south while we was going north,
huh? And it with half a million acres in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How come him to bring ary wagon up here anyhow?”
demanded Cal Taney, a top rider on Del Sol.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t ask him that,” said Del Williams quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I do”—retorted Nabours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I had some supplies, you know,” answered
McMasters. “A wagon goes better than a cart. You
said you didn’t want my wagon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A wagon carries trunks or boxes better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shore! Was you planning fer a load both ways—what
you’d kerry in a wagon from Del Sol?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may guess,” said McMasters, suddenly dull
red. “Most of you have guessed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have!” asserted Nabours. “Miss Taisie,
ma’am”—he turned to the white-faced girl—“this here
is hard for you. Del won’t talk and won’t vote. The
rest of us thinks the trunk and wagon is not explained.
Am I right, men?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Four men nodded. Del Williams, gentleman in rags,
sat staring straight ahead. The gray eyes of Dan McMasters
were fixed on the pale face of the woman whom
now he knew he had loved since first he saw her, would
always love. What price?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re the jury, ma’am,” said Nabours. “You’re
the judge. It looks to us like all along the McMasterses
was Yankee sympathizers. It looks like this man,
after all, was standing in with his own kind of politics
at Austin. That explains a lot of things that’s been
going on. Rangers? Arrest them folks? Huh! I’ll
bet they won’t stay in jail two days! You’ll have to
say sentence on this man we-all thought was square,
thought was our friend, a square Texan and a good man.
What shall it be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taisie Lockhart, Portia, spoke not of the quality
of mercy. Instead, she bowed her head in her hands
and wept without reserve. That act utterly changed
the whole complexion of the trial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dan McMasters threw up a hand—his left hand.
An instant later he was on his feet, but his attitude
had no hostility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait, men!” he commanded. “Don’t move, any of
you! I’ll pronounce sentence on myself!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, I don’t recognize any trial or any court
here—I came myself. But some men do fool things.
You’d like enough say death or banishment. All right!
Let it be banishment! You haven’t proved more than
a suspicion. I’ll accept banishment and leave the herd
quietly now—not taking anything but what I have
now, here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His face hardened into gray marble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If Miss Lockhart has had one suspicion in her mind
that I—that I’d—well, touch anything of hers, or of any
other human being’s, then it’s plain enough I don’t
belong here. I can’t square that for her. She can
never square that with me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no hand or voice raised at this. Turning
his back on them for the first time, McMasters swung
his belt to place, buckled it, caught his saddle horn and
was mounted and away, not looking back. He rode
gently, easily, straight. They knew no more of him
now than they had before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Del! Del, call him back!” broke out Taisie Lockhart.
But Del Williams shook his head. “I wish I could,
Miss Taisie,” said he simply. “I don’t reckon any of
us could now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It had to be,” said Nabours after a time. “I’ll pay
him back after we sell our herd. Del Sol can’t have no
obligations to him now. But he’s one of the mysteriousest
men ever crossed this range. He’s cold, that
man. He needs watching.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pay him back? What do you mean, Jim?” Taisie
was still in open tears. But she got no reply from her
foreman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a killer, Jim,” broke in Cal Taney. “We
know his ree-cord. He’s done killed five or six men
a’ready, young as he is—four since he was sher’f and
not countin’ Mexicans. He’s bad, that feller.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He never killed no man as sher’f that didn’t resist
comin’ along,” ventured Del Williams. “Them two
other men—one was coming at him with a ax, on the
buffalo range, and t’other had a even break on the street
o’ Uvalde. But no man has a chance with him on a
even break.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s cold,” reiterated Nabours, hesitant. But he
suddenly was agonized over the discharge of what he
had held duty to his owner—the hardest duty he had
ever known.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good thing fer us he was cold,” said Del Williams.
“He’d never have went out alone if things had popped
loose. He kep’ his mind and his hand to hisself. Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he knew why.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taisie Lockhart, alone in her encampment except
for her serving women, threw herself face down on her
blankets. A black and ominous world surrounded her.
She knew that yonder man, riding away into the twilight,
never would come back to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get your night horses staked, men,” ordered
Nabours gruffly, after the return to the encampment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Against a wagon wheel old Sanchez dreamily
thrummed a guitar. Sitting on his bed roll, a little apart
in the dusk, Cinquo Centavos, for the time off remuda
watch, engaged in song. His face was turned toward
a certain star, above a certain remote camp fire, a
quarter of a mile away. He thought his voice might
carry so far. He was fourteen, and very, very much
in love. His voice quavered and roared and broke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neeter, Wah-hah-ha-neeter, ast thy s-o-oul ef
we-e-e mus’ pa-a-art!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damn you, kid, shut up!” called the voice of the
foreman. “We got troubles enough.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span><h1>CHAPTER XII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE COW HUNTERS</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>A</span></span>T midnight the tired herd, after the strange
fashion of cattle, rose almost as with one impulse
and began slightly to straggle before
lying down on the other side. The four men then on
the watch, slowly riding two in each direction of the
round of the massed cattle, did not redouble their
monotonous crooning—time out of mind a range custom
in handling cows—but kept their spaces, knowing
the herd would soon again resume its rest. No unusual
sight or sound alarmed them. As Len Hersey said to
Del Williams, they handled sweet so far. The last
watch saw the herd rise for the morning, not yet beginning
to feed, standing, stretching. The cook began
duties of the day, grumbling to himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By now, without a word, the wrinkled Anita was
gathering bits of fuel, starting a tiny practicable blaze,
and groans could be heard from black Milly, still in her
cart, complaining of her misery. Frugal, but better
than the fare of these others who now moved here and
there between the tent and the massed brown blur of
the herd, was the breakfast for the owner of Del Sol.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun still was young when Nabours, moody,
morose, finished his snatched breakfast, got into saddle
and resumed his lead. Len Hersey was moved up to
the left point now. He and Del Williams dribbled the
thin forward edge of the loosely grazing cattle into
line. Without crowding, stopping, grazing, advancing,
the cattle again began to trail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No man mentioned the incidents of the night before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Roll erlong, little dogies! Roll erlong!” intoned
light-hearted Len. “I don’t give a damn where we’re
goin’, but we’re a-travelin’!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, Del,” he resumed, “did you see that night kid
when he fotch in the remuder this mornin’? He ain’t
got no coat, no slicker, and on’y one shirt, and his pants
is right wore out now. He was shiverin’ like a monkey
in a rain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he holler?” asked Del.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not oncet. And he lay his string on a new
horse and when he clim him the damn bronc he begin
high, wide and lonesome. But the kid sets him. ‘I
allus take a pitcher fust off, cool mornin’s,’ says he,
‘along of it’s bein’ so warmin’.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sinker’ll make a cow hand,” rejoined his companion.
“He ain’t no bigger fool than the rest of us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Back on the line of the great herd the swing men were
edging the cattle in. At the rear the two unhappy
drags were again in argument with the cook. With the
latter, old Sanchez agreed every new calf should be
shot and abandoned. Cal Taney opposed this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tain’t fer you, boy, to say what you’ll do er won’t
do. None o’ yore difference ef we pile calfs on yore
damn kyart tell their airs sweep the groun’. I reckon
afore us all gits to Aberlene we’ll have morn’n four
thousand newborned calfs—straight hundred per cent.
An’ ever’ one o’ ’em is a-goin’ to ride under or on top
o’ yore ole kyart. You better engage in prayer, nigger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was again high and hot noon. The herd had fed
and walked a half-dozen miles, and now some had lain
down in the shade of a live-oak fringe. Nabours, scouting
ahead, for an instant paused. Turning, he came
back at speed to his point men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Throw ’em off!” he called. “Hold ’em on this
flat! There’s a big herd ahead coming down from the
west. We don’t want to get mixed in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is it?” demanded Del Williams. “Somebody
ahead of us, going north?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kin savvy. No wagon in sight, and a right loose
drive. I’ll go back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He met the leader of the new herd, who was riding
to meet him; a tall, loose-clad man of aquiline features.
He was perhaps thirty-six years of age, and of a certain
gay assurance, as his laughing eye declared. His beard,
pointing down to his breast, was dark and glossy. Even
in his rags he did not lack in jauntiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How, <span class='it'>amigo</span>!” Nabours pulled up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Caballero!</span>” rejoined the other, grinning and extending a
brown and sinewy hand. “My name’s Dalhart, from
Uvalde. Which way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“North,” said Nabours; and no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You got a trail herd?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Si, Señor.</span> Fustest and damnedest ever went out o’
Caldwell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s your brand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“T. L.—we’re Del Sol people; old Colonel Lockhart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shore, I know you! Well, you’ll want to cut our
herd, for we got plenty o’ yore cows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Si, Señor.</span> You see, we’re a cow-huntin’ outfit—on
spec. We been out around seven months. Started
at the Nueces Cañon and worked north and west clean
almost into the Staked Plains. We cleared the Concho
and was over almost fur as the Pecos. We sold some
cows in yore brand to a outfit going to Sumner, and
’ll account fer them on our tally—less, say a dollar
a head for findin’. What they was doin’ clean over in
west away from home and off their range you’ll have
to say, fer I don’t know. What we got now in the T.
L. we picked up mostly on the Double Mountain Fork.
You know as well as me they don’t belong in there,
and how they got there is something I kain’t figure.
But we shore got three-four hundred o’ T. L. fours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I need ’em,” said Nabours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s others from even as fur north as Palo Pinto.
All north and west o’ where they belong at. What
pushed ’em west?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Friend,” said Jim Nabours, “you’re a cowman.
The truth is, Del Sol, and maybe more, has been reg’lar
skinned for two years. The push has been up and west,
toward the Llano. There’s been a big steal going on. It
looks like some big fellers was planning to stock that
open range as soon as the Comanches is got out of
there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How you figger that? And which way you headed
now yoreself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ever heard of Aberlene?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; what is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the head of the railroad. A three-dollar steer
here is wuth five-ten-fifteen-eighteen dollars up yon—we
don’t know how much. The news has just came
down. I’m trying to drive up the last leavings of our
cows—Miss Taisie Lockhart’s cows, to make a little
stake for her. We’ve been skinned by the gang at
Austin ever sence the war. What we know we can’t
always prove. I’m talking to a cowman.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. How
many men is in yore outfit?” he concluded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only six of us. We got pack horses, travel light.
But of all the antigodlin’ bunches o’ cows off their
range—I couldn’t tell you how many!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, us fellers don’t skin or drive to the coast
canneries. We just turn in any brands we get, and
folks usual pays us a dollar a head—er promises to. I
reckon we’ve picked up two-three thousand head. Lots
get loose in the thickets; we ain’t strong enough to hold
’em.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so you’re drivin’ for Miss Taisie Lockhart?
I’ve heard of her, clean down home. Orphant, huh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; and the damnedest whitest, squarest, worst-robbed
orphant in Texas. I’m shamed to show my
herd to a cowman, fer it’s the sorriest I ever seen. Now,
I want them fours, all you can spare of ’em. I’ll trade
you in cows just come in with calfs; I can’t get them
on north. Seems to me like a million cows, now, every
one of ’em, he taken this perticler time fer to bring
a nice spotted calf inter the world when he ain’t wanted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dalhart, the cow hunter, hooked a leg around his
saddle horn, and Nabours went on:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You take them cows, and calfs, right now, and throw
’en back on Del Sol, just below, and I’ll take what
fours and long threes you can spare. When we get
back next fall, ef we ever do, I’ll set ’em in yore brand
or vent ’em to any one you say, and I’ll credit you fifty
cents on each trade inside our own brand, or a dollar
if you’d rather have cash then. I’m playing her wide
open. Ef we bust on this drive anybody can have Del
Sol—corral, house, cows, calfs and all. I just don’t
want to be bothered with fresh she-stuff right now,
that’s all. As for money—friend, we ain’t got none.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor nobody.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know you said it! That’s why this Del Sol
herd’s important. We allow to bring back money.
We’ll settle then, and pay you a dollar a head fer fours,
damn glad, fer they was lost off the earth so fur as we
all was concerned. Well, you boys done swung over the
whole north and west of Texas? That’s the biggest
rodeo on spec I ever hearn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so much money,” said the other. “We started
twelve strong, all good men. One was killed by a horse.
Four was killed by Comanches. It was one fight after
another on the old Comanche road. We could only
bring through the leavin’s, too, like yourself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, what you say is fair. We’ll throw your she-stuff
back fer you—hit ain’t fur and they’ll go back
easy. Take what T. L. stuff we got rounded up—and
anything else you like. Comes to a orphant, no cowman
in Texas is going to ast to look at yore herd.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One bunch has,” said Nabours. “Some day I got
one or two scores to settle. But till I get back from
Aberlene on the railroad, I got neither time ner money.
Mr. Dalhart, our outfit’s broke! We’re eating borrowed
corn meal and hog meat, and borrowed where I
wish to God it wasn’t. Our remuda ain’t all our own.
And as fer our brand, I’ll bet you, outside the Fishhook
road brand, there ain’t hardly ary two head alike. I
been liberal. Please, sir, don’t comb our herd, because
it’ll make you dizzy. She’s a orphant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dalhart nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know. No man shall ride into yore herd, least
of all us. Take what you want out of our stray rodeo.
Ef you get back, settle with us fellers any way you like.
Down in Uvalde we know of Taisie Lockhart. Ain’t
a Texan but says hit’s a damn shame the way her father
was a-sassinated. Since the war, there ain’t no law and
no jestice in all Texas no more. Hit’s eena’most each
fer hisself, and no pay fer nothing. But orphants!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And like her!” said Jim Nabours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is she perty as she’s said fer to be?” smiled Dalhart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More! Come and see!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s three miles below, in our outfit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not lettin’ her go up the trail!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where else’d she go? She’s broke, and a reg’lar
organized gang working out her last head! What elset
could she do? Come back. We’ll talk things over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they sighted the scattered Del Sol herd, its
riders sitting loose, some of the men asleep in the saddle,
the little pair of white carts made first objective for
Nabours and his new-found friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The latter was not prepared for the vision of the tall
young girl who rode out to meet them. Somber of eye,
grave, sad, Anastasie Lockhart could no more deny
her youth, her beauty, her heredity, her education,
than she could negate the strong round figure, the clear
skin and the mass of ruddy hair which first impressed
this observer, not easily abashed, who now cast down
his bridle rein and advanced on foot to meet her, broken
hat in hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Lockhart, this is Mr. Dalhart, of Uvalde,”
began Nabours. “He’s just above, with a rodeo of
mixed stuff. He’s been on a cow hunt. He’s done
found cows. I was purposing a few things. We come
down to talk it over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taisie Lockhart held out her hand in shy, stiff fashion
that little comported with her inches or her masculine
garb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m shore pleased to meet you, Miss Lockhart,”
said the newcomer. He stood, a wild but not uncouth
figure, a typical border man of that fierce and self-reliant
land. “We have heard of Miss Lockhart as fur
south as Uvalde,” he added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Taisie smiled, a small dimple, very feminine,
quite often appeared on her left cheek. This now unsettled
Dalhart’s reason utterly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours now briefly outlined the proposition of trading
cows for beeves and making the herd more suitable
for the trail. Taisie Lockhart nodded soberly, by no
means ignorant of cows and cow methods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But now,” broke in Nabours presently, “Miss Taisie,
I’ll have to get a new hand somehow, out of Mr. Dalhart’s
outfit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes? We—we lost one, sir.” Taisie’s voice was
unsteady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cow hunter was, so it seemed, a simple man of
direct habits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I rid down, Miss Lockhart,” said he, “to ast fer
the job. Would ye take me? I kin ride and rope.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes, brown, direct, unabashed, looked fair and
square into the dark eyes of Taisie Lockhart. She
spread out her hands at length, with words of assent
which might have had a double meaning:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One more man? Very well.”</p>

to work in his new capacity. He had initiative,
seemed masterful, independent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me bring two or three of my boys down and
help you-all throw back a lot of these cows and calfs.
I’ll leave couple boys to hold our stuff. Come on up
again and look it over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They rode together until they reached the edge of
the wild range herd—literally the loot of a land untenanted—animals
wild as buffalo. Nabours gave the
herd the quick glance of the practiced cowman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yore stuff’s fatter’n ours,” said he; “yet you’ve
driv further.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shore,” replied the other. “We’ve been on a eight-hundred-mile
circle, like enough. Way out west, it’s
high and dry, and the vine mesquite grass, or the grama
north o’ that, curls down like nigger wool. There’s
cows here been raised on vine mesquite, fat as Christmas
ducks right now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hearn tell that away fur up north, thousand miles
er so, they got bunch grass and buffler grass that fats
cows the same way; though, o’ course, no cow critter
could live through them winters up north.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shore not—nor no man, neither, I reckon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, now, here’s the layout,” resumed Dalhart.
“Here’s two-three thousand to pick from. As I said,
you’ll find plenty T. L.’s. We got maybe three hunderd
slicks here and there, fer ourselves. Ef we got a dollar
a head straight through we’d be rich on the hunt. Yet
beeves at Sumner and north o’ there is fotchin’ fifteen
a head and up’ards.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ef we got half that at the railroad my boss’d be
rich on one drive,” said Jim Nabours. “Then we’d
have money enough to locate the gang that’s been pushing
stuff off this range. I don’t think we’ll need to
scrape Austin very damn deep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ain’t sayin’,” replied the cow hunter quietly. “Now
what I segest is that you-all cut yore light stuff and let
our boys throw it back on yore range. Take out’n our
herd as many head o’ good fours and drive ’em all north
under the Fishhook, T. L.’s and all the rest. When
you sell allow us a dollar a head for findin’ and tradin’.
Does that sound fair?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More’n such,” said Jim Nabours. “This first herd
is a expeariment for all of us. Let’s get the girl on her
feet fer sake of her father. And him oncet rich!” he
added. “As square a cowman as ever crossed leather.
I tell you, that bunch of shorthorns that’s come into
Austin done him dirt. Politics, that’s what’s under
it—Reconstruction politics. They think they can steal
this state because they win the war. Reconstruction?
I’ll bet one thing, ef I ever lay eye on the man that’s
been riding our range I’ll take him apart so’s’t he’ll
be damned hard ever to reconstruck again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now in the glare and heat and dust of the frank
Southern spring days, two dozen lank, lithe riders split
the two great herds, combed them both, blended them
both. Nabours’ face began to lighten as he saw forming
a real trail herd of marketable beeves and mature
cows. Of the unknown potential market at the rails
he really knew nothing. It might demand beef and
might ask stocking cattle. The discards of each herd,
the yearlings, the cows with calves, the lame and halt,
were to be cut back south for the later distribution on
their own home ranges.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole enterprise in which these two pastoral
chiefs now by chance were engaged was one of a day
now gone by forever, and it was conducted under standards
not understandable to-day. There was no law
but range custom. Texas was but thirty years this side
the time when twenty enormous land grants, given to
Americans, had covered practically all of her vast territory.
No scale of cattle values ever had been known.
On a strip of twenty-five miles here, not that many
miles from the capital of the state, now were assembled
almost ten thousand head of cattle. Had a buyer from
the North appeared he could have bought the lot at
three dollars and a half the head, and at the tally-out
he would as a matter of course have been asked to accept
the count as it ran, dogies, cows and ancient steers,
head for head. In those days a cow was a cow. All
horned kine, of any age or sex, were cows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again, as to the question of ownership, the gesture
of the day was alike close and hard, or large and lenient.
No man argued with his neighbor, since a cow was only
a cow. A man gave his cloak also to his neighbor if
asked—though woe to the man who laid hand on coat,
uninvited!</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the herd of these wild-cow gatherers were many
unbranded cattle—their own now by virtue of discovery,
the custom being “finders, keepers,” as to an unmarked
animal. For the mixed lot of the branded strays from
widely scattered herds a dollar a head seemed then a
fair pay for finding and herding for a hundred miles
or more. The adventurers who had taken on this speculation
of saddle and rope had rather considered a
dollar a head profit than range the find into the second
year—after which the increase of the strays would be
their own without possible contest. And a dollar a
head, payable perhaps next fall, was a thing large and
golden to the eye of the bearded, half-clad fighting men
who now, with no plan on their own part, had uncovered
a large plane of contact of the old with the new, of
the late past with a new and crowding present. But
for both parties, cow hunters and trail drivers, it was
all a speculation. The country north of them was an
unknown land. No values yet were established either
here or there. The West was yet in embryo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But all the time, as Nabours and Dalhart, respective
leaders, rode at their work, their wonder increased
at what each learned from the other. Some malign intelligence,
outrunning the apathy of the South in the
post-bellum period, had worked on more than a local
horizon. There had been a general pushing of the
range product into unsettled West Texas, as far as the
Comanches would admit. The trail to the Pecos River,
up which cattle had been driven to Army posts, the
pioneer work of Loving and Goodnight, the casual
Western drives of the half-breed Jesse Chisholm to
the Pecos crossing, must have been watched and known
by certain powerful groups of the new and avid carpetbag
politicians then crowding South.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That a covert range ring was working in Austin—as
a beef ring later was to work in Washington—as
well as a river-improvements ring which was hastening
to sell or take over all the state lands at a few cents
the acre; and that this sinister gang of far-sighted and
unscrupulous men had visions of a day of a vast empire
of their own, stocked with cattle which had cost
no more than the stealing, branding and driving, could
then be no more than suspected by Nabours or Dalhart.
But both men were shrewd. Both knew wild ways and
wild lands, and both knew cows, though neither had
any real vision as to the swift future of cows. They
knew that crooked work had been going on, of so
large and so vicious an extent as to violate all the ancient
and sacred law of custom, as well as the written law.
Both men were sober as they rode at their work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And to think,” said the old foreman of Del Sol,
“they wouldn’t spare even a girl like her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dalhart, lean and bearded adventurer in cows, nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But there ain’t none like her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours paused for a time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You been on our string three hours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three hours is enough, <span class='it'>amigo</span>. Three minutes
was enough. I’ve never knowed such a woman could
ever be in all the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s others think so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry for them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I’m going to marry that girl ef hit’s the
lastest thing I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Others has told me such,” replied Jim Nabours,
not so much concerned. “It’s right funny about women.
Now, I tried for all my early life to marry a girl down
in San Felipe. I done right well, and was going to
ast her; but another man done married her first. All
right, he done it fair, and I didn’t kick. I set down to
wait him out, and shore enough, he done die in about
ten year and she was a widder. I begin to save up
enough to git me new spurs and hat and saddle blankets,
and allow to begin courting of Sarah right after branding
time—and damn me, ef a Dutch colonist don’t up
and marry her afore I git around to it! He last four
year, and Sam Doan shot him one day over around
Round Rock. I was in debt to Sam fer that, fer now
Sarah was a widder oncet more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This time I didn’t lose no time. I rid over and told
Sarah how it laid. ‘Why, law!’ says she. ‘Why Jim,
I never knowed you choose to marry me, er of course
I’d of married you rather’n ary one of them others!
Why didn’t you say so?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Well, I say so now,’ says I. ‘Even ef I’m crowding
forty-eight, I say so.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So we done set the day. And right then the war
bust in our face and I rid off to the war. I sort of forgot
to git married to Sarah, in the excitement. Well,
when I come back I was apast fifty, and broke. When
I came to look things up I find Sarah has married a
Arkansaw widower with eight children over on the
Brazos!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That settled me with women. The game’s too damn
rapid fer a man like me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it ain’t going to be too rapid fer me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No? Now look here! Let me ast you something—and
let me tell you something. I ast you—likewise
I tell you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m that girl’s maw. I realize how much she owes
every man on these both two herds right now, but I
allow that the real men in this outfit has got to think
of her cows and not her—first, last and all the time, till
the said cows is sold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You willing to take left point on them grounds
and with that understanding? No love making on this
trail—not a damned word! Besides, you’ll tell me who
you are, after we get done driving and settle down to
courting?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His keen eye sought that of Dalhart, whose own met
it as fearlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a trade!” said he. “I’ll keep my word on that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that’s settled. Now, let’s set off the branding
gangs. We got to get at least four hunderd of these
fours in the Fishhook before night day after to-morrow.
That’ll keep us all from making love, I reckon. Blest
be the tie that binds! But you’re a T. L. hand now,
and not no more’n that. You got a naturalized citizen’s
right to love the boss, but you ain’t reached no years
of majority ner discretion this side of Aberlene.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim Nabours rode back in the twilight and flung
off from a foam-streaked horse at Taisie’s fire. The
tall girl came and seated herself beside him on a bed
roll, a hand laid on his knee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s wrong now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His quick eye noted her paleness. He knew she had
been weeping. A large gnarled brown hand of his
own stroked gently the slender brown hand on his
knee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Miss Taisie, ain’t nothing wrong, I’d say.
Fact is, everything is too damned right, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went on to tell her of the developments of the day;
how more than richly their exchange of discards for
beeves was working out; how well the herd was developing.
Then he came to what was on his mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, see here, Miss Taisie,” he went on, breaking
a bit of bark between his fingers, “when we started out
we thought we had stripped the Del Sol range. We
taken all ages. Only a act of God could of kept us
from having a plumb thousand calfs riding in yore
carts. But now looky here! We’re going to cut back
all that stuff and throw in fours instead. The cut is
going back to Del Sol. But who’s going to take care of
Del Sol while we go north?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, who could?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You could. Yes, Miss Taisie, you! We can git
along damn well without you, and Del Sol can’t get
along alone. Don’t you think you’d be safer back
home that way than what you will be going north up
to the sixth princerpul meridjun with sixteen pirates
and God knows what kind of weather?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re only a girl, Miss Taisie—the damnedest
finest girl ever borned in Texas; but girls is girls. I
can handle cows, Miss Taisie. I can’t handle girls.
You go on back home, please ma’am. We’ll pull in
afore Thanksgiving with a wagonload of Yankee
money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl straightened up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll not go back! I closed the doors when I started
up the trail. How could I live there alone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ain’t ast you to live there alone. What I say is,
we’ll be inside of ten miles of Austin when we cross
the Colorado. I want you and Del to ride in to Austin
and get married. Then I want you both to take charge
of this cut and ride on back to Del Sol.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man turned his gray grim eye to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t you leave me be yore maw, Taisie, child?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—no—no, Jim!” Both her hands were on his.
“Don’t ask me! I’ve nothing to live for outside of
what’s here on the ground. Everything I own I’ve got
with me, and all my friends. No, Jim, I’m going
through. No use to argue—no use to argue, Jim!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon not, ma’am,” said the old foreman, sighing.
“All I say is, God ha’ mercy, that’s all! I got a
dream there’s going to be hell on this herd.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>So was the genesis of Anastasie Lockhart, cow hand.
To-morrow came a creature who rode unconscious of
the horse beneath her, scornful of heat and dust as any
of these dust-screened figures, scarf over mouth, legs
clinging, body rhythmic, hands swift at the test moment;
a creature of incredible fascination, with all the
velocity and vitality of youth and strength. And before
her, seeking respite of her in violent activities,
passed vague, flitting, heroic figures, each of whom
rode his best for her—and each of whom eke left to
the tears of the recording angel crimes in cattle brands
they would have lost a hand before committing for
their own gain or that of any man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A vast picture, and a noble, that of the remaking of
the Del Sol trail herd. A shrouded yellow sun, hot and
again hot. The dulled green of a landscape of timber
and grass, of hill and valley, a wild land even then,
though under the eaves of the state’s capitol; a land partly
settled here, but tenanted under no real acceptance
of a social compact. Eager, early, primeval it was—all.
Youth of the world!</p>

<p class='pindent'>A tossing sea of wide-pointed horns, overhung with
a cloud of dust. Rattling and clacking inside the dust.
Rock of Ages; Jesus, Lover; Home, Sweet Home,
where lean riders held the mill. And always, cutting
through the cloud, one remorseless rider after another
edged his chosen victim out for the final rush and the
relentless sweep of the thin hide rope. Over and over
again, more than five hundred times before that cut
was done—twenty times, twenty-five in an hour, counting
them all—the little Southern horses sat down and
quarter-faced their quarry, each taking his own weight
and more in one wrench at his saddle horn and saddle
cinches, his gleaming eyes noting the hurled horned
creature, his victim also, at the other end of the rope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Calls of “Bring an iron!” And men sweating at a
half dozen fires were ready for that. Till his trembling
sides could no longer hold his great heart’s purpose,
each savage little horse went back into the dust under
a savage man. Two ropes for the heavy steers, two
sweating horses; twenty-five brands run in an hour,
perhaps—a task for four days done in two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A vast and splendid picture, and of a great day.
Since then two million men and women have mated
thereabouts. Yet now, center of that picture—and its
cause—there passed, hour after hour, gray, dusty, flitting,
tireless, the unmistakable and unconcealable figure
of a young woman.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yes, a creature of incredible
vitality and velocity, of life and youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Youth of the world!</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>D</span></span>AN McMASTERS, sheriff of Gonzales and
captain of state Rangers, rode into the straggling
village of Austin, capital of a state so
large a horseman could not cross it in a month. He
bore no outward evidence of having passed through
any agitating scenes. His apparel evinced no sign of
disorder, his face was coldly emotionless as ever. He
might have been almost any tall and well-clothed young
man. One thing only set him apart from the usual
visitor: By virtue of his calling he wore his two heavy
six-shooters. The handle of the left-hand gun pointed
forward; that of the right-hand weapon to the rear—a
puzzling combination to any student of possibilities.
Granted that he was a left-handed man, which hand
would first seek a weapon? Or if right-handed, which?
That was a problem which, lacking time, some half
dozen men had never solved to their own success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A certain red-faced, gray-haired and rather rotund
individual active in the office of the treasurer of the
commonwealth of Texas, sitting before a low-topped
desk in a room of the building which served as state
capitol, looked up as the newcomer entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good evening, sir,” said McMasters pleasantly.
“Do I find Mr. Rudabaugh in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The official made no immediate response.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do not,” said he finally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No? I infer that he is out of town?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” rejoined the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McMasters smiled innocently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In such case he is no longer in jail?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this the official displayed feeling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What business is it of yours?” he demanded. “And
how do you know he is in jail? He didn’t stay there
longer than it took to call court. There are not people
enough in Texas to keep Mr. Rudabaugh in jail.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I heard that a deputy United States marshal took
him and his party the other day, below the Colorado,
and sent him in with a force of Rangers. As you say,
it might have been supposed that no court in this town
would hold him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The red-faced official abated somewhat of his pompousness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From what I’ve heard in description, I believe you
are Mr. McMasters, sheriff of Gonzales,” said he presently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am that same, sir,” replied McMasters smilingly.
“If I needed to quote Davy Crockett, I might say that
I have the closest shooting rifle and the best coon dog
in the whole state of Texas. Yes, I’m McMasters of
Gonzales.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” began the other, embarrassed, “it’s only right
to tell you that at the preliminary hearing all those men
were discharged.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is why I called. I wanted to talk things over
with Mr. Rudabaugh. I thought I might be able to
explain one or two things to him. I thought maybe I
might be of some use to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silence of the other, now afraid to speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where can I find Mr. Rudabaugh?” The quiet
voice took a new note.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I can’t answer. He left town again yesterday
morning, with some other gentlemen. They headed
west.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It looks as though Mr. Rudabaugh thinks I still
am after him. Perhaps he has been mistaken about
my motives and purposes with him. Perhaps he forgets
that my father voted and worked against slavery,
the same as the gentlemen of your party did. Why
antagonize Gonzales? Why fight the Rangers?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, what I want to tell Mr. Rudabaugh is this:
I know where that trunk of Texas land scrip is to-day.
I am ready to tell him where it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The official coughed, embarrassed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was what he wanted to get hold of at Del
Sol. Well, I got hold of it myself. I know where it is
to-day. I can take him to it at any time he likes. Does
that sound interesting?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The red-faced man sat up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It sounds strange, coming from you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, there are times when it’s hard to get the truth.
I never found much use in showing all my own hand
in public. A peace officer has to be careful. Perhaps
the state treasurer has misunderstood me. Perhaps I
am willing to work with him for a little time, and not
against him. How then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Rudabaugh and his associates, too, have been
very much misunderstood by the people of Texas,”
began the state official. “He is a man of large ideas,
a man of vision. Our friends of the other party prefer
to see Texas remain as she always has been—remote,
impoverished, with no commercial outlook, no hope
on earth. Mr. Rudabaugh sees a wider future for
Texas. We all do here.” He spoke virtuously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Precisely! Well, I’m one of the growing number
of Texans who’d agree with him on that last. We don’t
deny that there are chances in land and cows such as
we never dreamed. The men who work fast in Texas
now will be rich—as rich as they like. But we can’t
always climb up on the housetop and tell all the world
about the means and methods. Of course, that means
that some may misunderstand such men as Mr. Rudabaugh.
You know that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, yes, of course; I know the way Mr. Rudabaugh
himself works—always decisive, never telling
much of his plans. His friends deplore the criticism
he has received in certain quarters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, he has occasion to be cautious. Still, if Mr.
Rudabaugh, not as state treasurer but as president of
a certain land-and-cattle company, has any wish to confer
with the man who saw him arrested the other day,
when he was inquiring about a certain block of additional
land scrip, that man is willing to talk with him
now. We might find something of mutual interest.
You-all here in Austin might do worse than make
friends down Gonzales way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McMasters smilingly waved a hand at either gun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not quite alone. We will both have to come
under a white flag. If he wants to be <span class='it'>muy amigo</span>, maybe
I can be of service to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His gray eyes, now narrowed, were fixed without
wavering upon those of this other man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me, where is Sim Rudabaugh!” he demanded
suddenly. The man behind the desk started as though
under an immediate menace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, since you seem to offer your aid, Mr. McMasters,
in a misunderstanding—a very deplorable misunderstanding—I
presume I may tell you. He’s gone
north, up the trail, toward the Brazos. He’s on some
private business of his own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes? He’s in camp, waiting for the big Del Sol
herd? Where is his camp?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The desk man grew very uneasy; but at length he
replied hesitantly: “Well, I’d take the trail that runs
due north from San Marcos if I had to find him. I
would say he might be camped a ride of a day and a
half north of here—say, thirty to fifty miles north, on
the general road to Fort Worth village.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t know where that herd is, do you?” he
added. “Mr. Rudabaugh regards its going north as a
very grave mistake; indeed, a risky and ruinous thing
for the state at just this time. You don’t know where
the herd is now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I do know. I’ve just come from it. It’s been
held up a few days in west of here. They may get
over the Colorado by to-day. I ought to be able to
find Mr. Rudabaugh well in advance of the herd itself,
then, you think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you didn’t tell me where the scrip is.” The other
man flushed at seeing his eagerness noted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said McMasters slowly, “you yourself and
I myself are not supposed to know a damned thing
about that chest of papers, are we? But we do, eh?
Well, when we find the T. L. cows we will come pretty
near finding that scrip. And scrip is going up, eh?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’ll tell you this much, my friend. I know all
about the moves of Mr. Rudabaugh’s big company
to get holdings west toward the edge of the Staked
Plains—on the Double Mountain Fork and above there.
You see? Well, I don’t see why you and I should beat
about the bush. I know all about the operations that
have driven almost all the central range’s holdings on
out farther west.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are a lot of things I know. Well, do you
think I am safe to trust? And don’t you think the
administration might do worse than be friendly to Gonzales
and Uvalde?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other man drew himself up with a long sigh of
doubt, apprehension, but made an attempt at merriment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said he, “of course, this is the first time we’ve
met. I don’t know that I’d trust you to take care of me,
but I believe I’d trust you to take care of yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I always have,” said McMasters simply. “That’s
why I’m here now. Suppose you and I have a little war
council, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When McMasters walked his horse down the long
street of Austin town, rifle under leg, he looked neither
to the right nor to the left, though well aware of the
scrutiny which followed him from more than one door
and window. The reputation of the mysterious, always
restless sheriff of Gonzales, captain of the newly revived
state constabulary, was one that reached beyond the
confines of his own county. No one had looked for
him in Austin—to the contrary. But then, as one man
said to a neighbor, McMasters, of Gonzales, could always
be counted on to be doing some unaccountable
thing.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span><h1>CHAPTER XV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>NORTHWARD HO!</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>T</span></span>HE reconstructed and augmented Del Sol herd
passed on northward steadily, as though impelled
by some cosmic force. It had required
well-nigh a week to cut the two herds and blend them
into one, for handling heavy beeves in the open is vastly
different from the work of the corral and branding
chute on light cattle. At the end of the work the
remuda was dragged and drooping, the men yet more
taciturn. But they could look out with pride over well-nigh
four thousand head of longhorns such as would
make any cowman’s eye brighten even in that day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, daily more accustomed to the trail, the cattle
shook down to the daily march. At dawn they did not
feed at first; but, never urged to speed, in an hour or
two would graze along, halting in the march, advancing,
the concourse at times stretched out over more than a
mile, perhaps a quarter that distance in width. At
midday, thrown off the trail—if trail it could be called
which as yet had never known a herd—they grazed well,
and in that portion of the country could find water
two or three times a day; so that they took on or held
flesh rather than lost it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did ary one of you-all ever hear how far it is to
Aberlene?” asked Nabours of his new man, Dalhart,
whom he had put on point in view of his obvious education
as a cowman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Must be e’en around about a plumb thousand miles,”
replied the latter. “Hope hit’s thisaway all the ways—plenty
of grass and the rivers full enough fer water
right along. We ain’t had to hunt water yet. You’d
orto see the Llano! We’ve driv two days, out yan,
with their tongues hangin’ out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Water! When we hit the Colorado I thought we
got plenty water. She’ll swim a horse in a dry year,
and she swum us for more’n a hundred fifty yards!
I was mighty glad to ferry them carts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uh-huh. Ner that ain’t all—the Brazos’ll do the
same, and only luck’ll save us from swimmin’ a quarter
mile, maybe, on the Red. Then beyond that’s the
Washita, narrer but deep. I never talked with no man
that ever was north of the Chickasaws. We’ll wet our
saddles plenty, shore. What cows we don’t drownd
and the Injuns don’t steal, or that don’t get lost in night
runs—why, that’s what we’ll have to sell. Four thousand’s
a big herd to han’le—too big—but I’ve gethered
cows long enough to know a feller better git plenty
when the chancet comes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>North of the first unbridged river—the Colorado—the
advance was over a country practically new, although
now subdivided into organized counties. The
main thrust of the early population was from the south
and lower east, so that now the farther north they got
the sparser grew the infrequent settlements. All North
and Northwest Texas remained <span class='it'>terra incognita</span> even for
Texans, and no map of it ever had been made, let alone
of the wild Indian Territory that lay north of it. The
thousands of longhorns, the first herd ever to go north
from a point so far south in Texas, plodded along,
never turning a backward foot, but hourly finding a
new land. Austin was a county-seat town rather than
a capitol city. Such communities as Temple, Waco,
Cleburne, Fort Worth—all close to the ninety-eighth
meridian, along which lay the general course of the first
of the cattle drives before the trails moved west—were
cities in embryo; Fort Worth, through which bodily
the trail ran, had then not over one hundred inhabitants;
enough for a metropolis in a state that had not
a hundred miles of rails and no trace of a lasting market
for the one great commodity—cows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Across a half dozen counties, a dozen lesser streams,
the singular procession passed onward, epochal, in an
abysmal ignorance and a childlike self-confidence. Its
course was due north; and since now the grass was good
and water courses full, it needed to make no digressions.
The herd left a trail a hundred yards wide, two hundred,
half a mile; but the main road remained written plainly
for any who might follow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours was cowman enough not to crowd his cattle
on a march of such indefinite duration, but continually
he fretted over the necessary slowness of the journey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s good country,” he admitted to Del Williams;
“can’t complain; grass all right; high enough, but not
washed out; and a good creek every forty rod almost.
But I never did know Texas was so big. Here we are
into May, and when we make the Brazos we’ll be only
maybe a hunderd and fifty mile north of where we
started at. It’ll be anyways a hunderd years afore we
make Aberlene, ef there is any such place, which I doubt,
me. Not one of us knows nothing, and nary one has
ever been even up here afore. We’ll just about hit the
Red when she’s up full.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We ain’t there yit,” rejoined his new point man
cheerfully. “We may all git drownded in the Brazos;
an’ ef we do we won’t need worry none about the Red.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had not yet lost all touch with the settlements;
indeed, continually crossed the great pastures of men
who under range custom held their own river fronts
and range. Now and again a sort of trace led them
north—the compass finger of fate always pointed north
and not west for the state of the Lone Star. But of
actual road there was none, fences were undreamed
and bridges never yet had been held needful for traveling
man. When, therefore, they struck the great Brazos,
coming down as did all these upper rivers from the
east rim of the mysterious Llano Estacado, it was relief
to Nabours to find a pair of rough boats which he
fancied he could lash together into ferriage for his
troublesome carts and their timid passengers. For the
herd a swimming crossing once more was necessary,
and demand was made once more on the native generalship
of the foreman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put ’em in warm, men,” he said to his men at the
camp fire in a great arm of the river. “Ef a cow’s
warm and the sun’s shining he’ll take the water easy.
Ef he’s chilly he begins to think of home and mother.
We’ll rest ’em here till late to-morrer morning. The
bank’s highest on the south side and we can throw ’em
in easy. I don’t think there’s more’n a hunderd yards
or so of swimming, no ways.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His judgment proved good for an amateur—as all
trail drovers then were. Well warmed, the herd strung
into the ford amiably enough, led by the point men and
pushed by the swings. The horse herd already had been
crossed, for horses swim better than cattle, and have
more courage at a wide crossing; and this laid down the
line for the herd leaders, who went in readily enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The long line of the cattle, as it reached the swimming
channel, was swept down stream in a deep U,
but when they caught footing and made up the farther
bank the line was established and the crossing went on
steadily, the line never broken and not a head lost out
of the great total. It went forward as though in an
accustomed routine; and this first successful essay in
crossing big water gave confidence to all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the saddle horses, including Blancocito, had to
swim, and so did the yoke oxen of the carts. The owner
of the herd patiently waited her turn. Old Anita
crossed herself for two solid hours, sure her end had
come. Milly found her relief in loud and tearful lamentations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What ever brung us-all ’way up yere?” she exclaimed.
“My folks wuz Baptists, and so’m me; but
what I says is, I done been baptized oncet and dat’s
plenty. I’m a notion to walk back home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No you won’t,” said the trail boss, who with his
best man had come back to see to this last work. “You
and Anita set right on yore cart seats. Miss Taisie’ll
take care of you. Ef you drownd we can get plenty
better cooks, so don’t you worry. Ef you did float
off, you couldn’t sink noways. Anita’s the one in danger—she’s
all bones. You set in the middle and say yore
prayers like Anita does.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you worry none, ma’am,” he added, addressing
Taisie. “I’m going to take them two John boats
somebody has left here and make a raft that’s safer
than a bridge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His process gave proof of the Texan’s strange distrust
in all boats and confidence in all horses, although
it showed no less the resourcefulness of the real explorer,
crossing country with such means as lay at hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was no great matter to rope the two broad-horn
scows together side and side, and to lay a pole platform
across to receive the carts, which were run on by hand.
Remained the question of propulsion, and none of these
knew aught of sail or pole or oars. This meant falling
back on the <span class='it'>vade mecum</span>—the horse, without which in
his day the railroads and bridges might as well never
have been.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours lashed his cart wheels fast to his craft, so
that he could risk strain on them. Then he got a long
pole, some thirty feet in length. All the time singing
and whistling to himself, and vouchsafing no answer
to any, he passed this across the body of the foremost
cart and lashed it fast. The ends projected widely at
each side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I got a steamboat now,” said he to his followers,
“but I ain’t got no side paddle wheels. Ride in there,
you points—Dalhart, and you, Del—you’re side wheels.
When you get under the ends, each of you reach up and
tie yore saddle horn to the end of the pole. Then swim
back yoreselfs. The horses couldn’t sink ef they wanted
to, and I don’t reckon there’s only one way they can
swim, and that’s acrost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Theirs not to reason why, the two men obeyed, managing
to get into the boat, which still lay aground, the
side-wheel horses standing not over belly deep, each
encouraged by its rider, who lay along the gunwale
anxiously. But when at length the thing was put to
the test by bodily pushing the clumsy contrivance into
the current, the unique experiment proved a success.
The horses, finding themselves carried off their feet,
began to swim vigorously, their instinct or their intelligence
leading them to head angling upstream. The result
was that the craft, even thus heavily loaded, made
astonishing headway; indeed, finding a landing just below
the ford end established by the herd. With shouts
and laughter the remaining men once more swam their
horses over in the wake. The crossing, so novel that
even Taisie forgot her fears, was made with expedition
and in perfect safety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s easy,” said Jim Nabours, modestly answering
the compliments of his men. “Of course, ef ’twasn’t
for the womenfolks we wouldn’t have to bother. A
feller couldn’t keep house without a horse, could he?
Ain’t nothing a horse and a rope can’t do. My horse
swum me over twicet, and didn’t hardly wet the saddle
to the tops of the rosaderos. There ain’t nothing safe
as a horse, ma’am.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you men go on and string ’em out”—he turned
to his well-wetted associates. “They’re all over and all
ready to move. It’s a dandy crossing. We’ll bed three
or four miles on, if it looks good. Feed ’em slow and
get ’em full. A full belly’s the best way to handle a
cow. I’ll push on ahead right soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just now he rode over to the moody figure that sat
her reclaimed horse at the upper side of the fording
trail. His face was frowning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Taisie,” said he, “one thing I’ve got to tell
you. There ain’t going to be two trail bosses on this
herd. It’s you or me. Now I want to say that we can’t
be over about thirty of forty mile from Fort Worth.
I reckon you and Del can get married there, huh? Then
you still could ride back home to Del Sol. I don’t know
what there is ahead. We ain’t more’n started. I can
take chances for myself, and men and my cows—but
not for you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jim! Why, Jim!” She laid a hand on his soaked
sleeve. “You don’t think I’m a quitter, do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord knows I don’t, ma’am! I wisht you was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jim! The lone herd of Del Sol, the first out of
Texas? Something big, Jim! I don’t think I’ll be
scared any more. It wouldn’t be playing square with
you-all to get married and go back home.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Home?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned quickly. Tears again were on the girl’s
cheeks. With a savage groan he caught the cheek strap
of Blancocito and led her to the vehicles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You Milly, damn yore black Baptist hide, quit yore
shouting and build a fire! Make some coffee for Miss
Taisie. I’ll tell Sinker to hold the remuda back, Miss
Taisie. You-all come on up then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently Cinquo Centavos rode up, shy and grinning,
abashed yet happy at being appointed personal
guardian of his deity. Thin, burned brown, ragged,
his hat almost no hat at all, boots and saddle alone
marked him worthy to join these other men—these and
his instinctive mastery of horseflesh. At sight of Milly
clambering down over the cart wheel—indeed a dismaying
spectacle—his mount began to plunge and pitch.
The boy sat him, annoyed. Taisie waved a hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine, Cinquo!” she called. “I like to see you ride.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy smiled as he jerked up the head of the horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t make him pitch, ma’am,” said he. “He’s
jest done that hisself. I reckon it was the sight o’
Milly’s laigs. He’s all right now.” He dismounted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How are you coming on, Cinquo?” inquired his
mistress. “Getting to be a regular trail man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ain’t lost a head yit, ma’am,” said the youth simply.
“One D Slash hawse turned back this mornin’, but I
crossed him. I got my hull bunch. Now we’re over
two-three rivers; they won’t turn back now. Hawses
is a heap reasonabler than cows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jim says you work too hard. You don’t need to
be up all night on a remuda, he says—horses stick together.
You don’t have to watch them every minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shore they do, ma’am. You don’t bed ’em and tuck
’em in like you do cows. I wouldn’t be no cowman,”
superiorly. “Gimme two-three weeks on the trail,”
he added eagerly, “I wouldn’t hatter watch so hard,
like now. They feed against the wind, ma’am. I got
the bell on that big white Del Sol mare. I allus listen
which way the bell is soundin’, and so I allus know where
they’re at: Why, sleep? I slep’ most a hour last night.
When I don’t hear the bell I wake up. It’s easy if you
savvy hawses. I ain’t gwine to lose nary head, to Aberlene,
ma’am.” He colored deeply. “I—well, I ain’t,
now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got all good men, Cinquo,” said his deity.
“They savvy cows and savvy horses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, ma’am.” The boy’s throat gulped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have some coffee, Cinquo,” said Taisie. “Milly,
give Cinquo something to eat. He hasn’t lost a head.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seated comfortably on the ground, Cinquo grew
more confident.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ma’am, ain’t the nights han’some?” he ventured.
“So bright, quiet-like. Times, I lay on the groun’ by
my hawse; come midnight, I kin hear the bell, and hear
my hawses blow, nighest ones; er sometimes hear the
cows grunt and blow, too, bellies full and right contented.
So all the world’s kind o’ happy-like. And the
stars is so fine, ma’am! Don’t you think so? Like
glass, they air. Seems like God must ’a’ busted a winderpane
and slammed the pieces right up agin the sky,
and they stuck there, shinin’ like they was wet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Cinquo. So you’ve noticed the stars too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then we both do!” he exulted. His young, shy
eyes shone. Indeed, he was her knight, ready to risk
all in her honor. So were his nights borne, sleepless
in ardor and reverence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stahs!” broke in Milly. “Stahs! They’s common!
I know whaffur I go Nawth—I gwine to git me a apple!
Onliest apple I ever done et,” she explained, “were what
Sher’f McMasters gimme. He taken it out’n his saddle
pocket and said would I eat it? ‘Mister Sher’f,’
says I, ‘what setch a thing like disher cost now?’ says I.
‘Oh, it mout ’a’ costed fifty cents,’ says he, ‘’cludin’ of
freight.’ ‘Huh,’ says I, ‘ef it cost fifty cent, I reckon
Ah gwine to stahve on, stahve on!’ But some time, ef
ever I git Nawth, and ever I git whah apples is at, an’
ain’t nobody a-lookin’—u-m-m—huh! Now, Mr. Dan
McMasters, he sayed——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go get my horse, Cinquo!” broke in Taisie Lockhart
imperatively. “Milly, pack the dishes. Come, we
must get on!”</p>

Cinquo’s description in their pointed brilliances.
The wind was nothing now, the
silence, save for a few quavering coyotes, was deep and
full of peace. Contentment sat on the wild bivouac.
On a gentle slope well-nigh four thousand cattle were
lying close packed in a vast oval, less than a fifth of a
mile in extent, half that distance across on the lesser
axis. Bedded on high, dry grass, in the path of the
breeze, themselves full of grass and water, they lay,
heads high, level with their cover, blowing and chewing,
eyes closed and happy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fire points of the cook’s evening meal now barely
showed. Afar came the faint sound of men’s voices,
singing—the night watch riding slowly, two men in
one direction, two in the opposite, fifty feet or so back
from the bedded animals. These latter in some vague
way knew they were protected. They lay and grunted
dully, having ended one more day of their march toward
fate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ain’t that enough to make a cowman happy?” said
Nabours to Del Williams, nodding toward the herd as
they lolled by the fading fire. “You couldn’t kick ’em
up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We ain’t started yet, Jim,” said the young Texan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How come we ain’t? It couldn’t be much over four
hunderd mile to Red River Station from Del Sol. Them
cows is plumb gentle already.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to roll in, Del. You and Dalhart better
go on at midnight, I reckon. Watch the Dipper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Afar, at the established distance from the watchers,
the tiny fire at Taisie’s tent fell flickering into absorption
by the night. Taisie lay, wide-eyed, looking out
through the tent front at the myriad-pointed sky. She
told herself that it was the coffee taken late, but she
knew that was not why she did not sleep. Or, if she
slept, she wakened always with the picture before her
of a ring of men, one facing her, his eyes calm, although
he was being tried on the point of honor dearest
to any man. It was worse than trying him for his
life, she knew that. Had she, Portia, <span class='it'>provocateur
général</span>, judge, jury, been just?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Restless, confined by the oppression of the tent, Taisie
drew her blankets beyond the flaps and tried the open air.
Came the stertorous sounds of Milly’s sleep, the cough
of the few animals picketed near by. She raised on
elbow and looked to the tiny row of brush, piled as
windbreak by old Sanchez. He and his wife Anita
always slept so, with one scant serape above them. But
they slept. She could not sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She raised higher on her elbow, looked up at a sudden
sound. Blancocito was standing, ears pointed toward
the fringe of mesquite that flanked their little eminence.
He had flung up his head, snorting. She turned,
would have risen, for she was a fearless soul and reared
on the border. Could it be Indians?</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that instant she felt a powerful hand close over
her mouth. An arm forced her to the ground. She
looked up into the face of a man! He was a tall man,
a strong man. Suddenly she ceased struggling. She
knew what man this was!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But why, as he crouched beside her, holding her
down, stifling her voice, did he, too, look with eyes
fixed where those of the plunging horse just had been,
toward the edge of the thicket?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush!” She heard his voice, though he kept his
head up. “Don’t call out! Where is the little trunk?
Have you got it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She nodded, under his stifling hand, or would have
done so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You thief!” she tried to say. “Oh, God curse you!”
For now she felt her sentence had been just. “Oh,
you thief!” she said, or thought she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But though again she writhed and tried to call, no
sound came save the hard whistling of her nostrils,
coveting air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she almost tore free—did tear free. Crouching
almost over her, his body above hers, one hand
holding her down, suddenly she saw him go to one
knee, saw a move of his free arm. Her eardrums were
almost shattered by a double explosion just above her
head. He had fired at something in the dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Came medley of night alarm—horses snorting, men
calling. Taisie’s senses could give no sequence to all the
varied sounds. She caught the rush of hoofs toward
the mesquite, thought that her horse had been stolen;
heard a man’s scream in the night, where she supposed
the thief had shot one of her own men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But concurrently she heard another sound, one which
terrified every man who also heard it—the rumble and
thunder of four thousand cattle, wakened by vague
terror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sounds of shots in the night were not usual,
not understood by them, hence ominous of ill. Jumping
to their feet, addled by the slumber in their eyes, their
tails high and rolling, their horns rattling, the herd by
instinct turned in the direction opposite the sounds of
terror. Then, swayed by the one blind instinct left to
them, they broke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two of the night watch, caught by the storm of horns,
were pushed away, barely keeping ahead in the night.
The dreaded run was on. In the night was no peace
at all. No, nor peace in this girl’s soul.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>With the first burst of the herd every man in the
camp was on his feet and hurrying for his night horse.
Each knew what to do. There was no oriflamme, but
the ominous roll and clack ahead made command, guidance.
The one thing was to ride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first salvation for any man meant leaving everything
to the horse. To check or attempt to guide him
meant death. Of better night sight than his rider, and
no more eager than he to be trampled into a bloody
pulp, the horse would put out unasked his limit of speed
and care of footing. Trust him, also, to edge ahead
or outside of any enveloping part of the herd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But after a mile of this madness in the dark, the
master intelligence began to assert its purpose, to control
brute terror. Those at the flank, at the rear, began
to see points and streaks of flame. The two men ahead,
at last free on the edge of the run, were crowding their
horses against the front ranks of the cattle, jostling into
them the best they could in a perilous give and take,
firing their six-shooters across the faces of the leaders,
trying to force them into a mill; such being the proper
psychology in cows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pistol lightning dwindled to firefly points, ceased.
The reports had not been audible over the roar of the
run. No one could reload the cap-and-ball revolver,
and six shots left the pursuer reduced to quirt and spur.
To the few who remained at the encampment, there
passed a lessening storm of sound. So at length came
silence and suspense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thinking that the first two shots had been fired by
some of his own men, or possibly by a frightened woman,
Nabours left no guard at the camp. The side
encampment alone had tenancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two women of Taisie sprang from their sleeping
places and ran to the little tent, not to protect their
mistress but to seek protection—Sanchez was gone with
the others. They saw her, in the dim light, standing
close to a tall man. This was certainly not a true man
of Del Sol, for he was not riding now. They ran back,
undecided; could not see or hear what went on in the
gloom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A voice spoke low to Taisie’s ear—a voice she knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The little trunk—is it in your tent?” The hateful
question, itself an accusation for the asker, was repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!” she got strength to say, clutched by her fears,
her anger, her sudden hatred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is it, then? Quick!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll not tell you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right! But watch out for it! They’re after it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were after it! Who were “<span class='it'>they</span>”? And who
was this? Under which flag, all along, has been Dan
McMasters, sheriff, captain?</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not hear his voice again. Suddenly, as
though he sensed her indecision, she felt herself swept
to his body as she stood, her own strong body helpless
under strength of his. No hand was on her mouth,
but she could not cry out. She felt his cheek laid against
her cheek—for one half instant; heard a sigh, a gasp,
felt at her temple then a kiss as light and gentle as the
embrace had been ruthless and savage. Then she was
free.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stood alone. He was gone. Yes, he went that
way, in the direction the flame of the two shots had
lined out. He went lightly, swiftly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And in the morning, when first they sought why the
great buzzards were hopping, they found a man, a dead
man, with his hands crossed on his breast and his hat
drawn down over his face. It was not Dan McMasters.
None of them knew who it was. But Taisie Lockhart
knew that Dan McMasters had killed this man. Why?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Sanchez, first back from the run, who first
saw this dead man in the daylight, and he knew him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Nombre de Dios!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sanchez crossed himself. He knew the man’s feet,
his boots, his spurs. Not so long ago he had tied those
feet under a horse’s belly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sanchez coursed like a questing hound for the sign.
Many tracks of horses. A loose horse without the
Fishhook brand. All of which made mystery enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Taisie,” demanded Milly, “You’se all a-trimble,
chile! Who dat man? Who him were standin’
thah?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She caught the hand Taisie had against her bosom,
the hand that covered her temple.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! I don’t know!” she heard her mistress say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Jim Nabours was harder to satisfy when he
came in soon after sunup, his face lined as though he
had lost pounds in the night ride. He cursed openly
as he snatched loose his cinches and turned off his trembling
and sweat-stained night horse. Then he turned
to Taisie, who had come over to the men’s camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who done it?” he demanded. “You a-shooting at
some shadow? Look what you done! We get this run,
just when they was gentling. I thought you was a cow
hand!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl was on the point of saying that, yes, she
had shot; that she was sorry. She put a hand to her
temple.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He had kissed her there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jim, I did not shoot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who did, then? That fool nigger woman? You—Milly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me? I never didn’t. My gun only shoots oncet.
Two shoots come, right at Miss Taisie’s tent. So help
me on my Bible, Mr. Jim, I never did shoot not none.
No, sah!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who was it, Taisie?” He used her as a child now,
but his voice was sad. “The shots was right at this
place. Who was it—one of our men?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Jim, no!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who was he? Tell me now! You’re hiding him?
You know who he was?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A very long silence. The man’s face was fronting
her, streaked with the dust. He was a loyal man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, “Yes!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now she faced him. Nabours guessed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“McMasters! You know why he came? Ah, Taisie,
girl!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know! I think it was the trunk. He said
something about it—I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the scrip, Taisie! He’s following that still?
What did he say? Ask where it was?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. But he said to look out for it, to watch it.
I don’t understand——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I understand that that renegade McMasters is a
thief and a scoundrel. We never orto of let him go!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She could not make reply. The world was getting
too much for her, overcoming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sanchez!” she said pointing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An exclamation broke from Nabours when he saw
Sanchez fling an arm, heard his faint call. He got on
a horse, galloped over to where Sanchez stood, dismounted.
Then he also saw the dead man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know-a-dis-a <span class='it'>hombre</span>, Señor Jeem!” Sanchez
was excited. “We send-a heem to jail. I tie-a da
foot. How come-a heem here while he’s in jail? <span class='it'>Nombre
de Dios!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But who killed him, Sanchez?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours saw the two wounds, an inch apart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Quien sabe</span>, Señor?” replied Sanchez gravely. “I
just find-a heem now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the tired brain of Jim Nabours, up all night and
strained to his limit over the scattered herd, only grew
more muddled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let him lay!” he ordered savagely. “That’s one
more, anyhow, no odds who got him. Buzzards is too
good for him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Taisie,” he began again as he found her at
the cook fire, “that’s one of the Rudabaugh gang, all
right. If it was Dan McMasters killed him he done it
by mistake; he thought it was one of our men. Afore
he went, he folds this corp’s hands and covers up his
face with his hat. What more could he do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl sat silent, her face cold as some cameo in
ice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Taisie Lockhart”—the old foreman’s voice was
hard now—“one thing at least—you don’t need no
more proof now! That’s over, anyhow!”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='151' id='Page_151'></span><h1>CHAPTER XVII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>MR. DALHART DECLARES</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>“O</span></span>N OUR way, Sanchez!” commanded Nabours,
breaking the tense silence of the disheartened
camp. “We’ve got to get back. The boys
are holding three or four bunches over thataway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Seguro</span>, Señor Jeem,” replied the old man. He
nodded. Yet another rider was coming in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s Dalhart. He ought to know something.
We’ve got to have fresh horses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Poco tiempo!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The keen ear of the old Mexican again served. Afar
they heard a tinkling. From behind a screening mesquite
fringe showed the head of the remuda, following
a gray bell mare at a stiff trot. Back of the horses
rode Cinquo, his clothing stripped, his face bloody and
pale. He got no word of praise, nor asked one. The
black bruises on his legs showed through his ripped
jeans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” The trail boss turned to Dalhart, grimed
and dust-covered, who had brought a tin cup to the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve got around a thousand head, maybe twelve
hunderd. Del and two boys are holding ’em on a flat
this side the pecan bottoms—three mile, I reckon.
Ain’t it hell? They scattered like pa’tridges. I ain’t
seen no one else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Yo</span>, me an’ dos hombres!” began Sanchez, excited,
pointing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damn it, talk English, Sanchez!” interrupted Nabours
savagely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Seguro; muy bien, Señor Corporal</span>,” rejoined Sanchez.
“I say, two man and me, we got plenty <span class='it'>vacas</span>
round up. They send-a me for tobac’. We got h’eight,
seven hoonderd head, <span class='it'>piense qu’ si</span>. Most half-a da
herd.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not half yet. Well, Dalhart, I’ve got to ride the
fan. Stay here and watch things. We’ll make the
gethering to this bed ground.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But who done that shooting anyway?” demanded
Dalhart suddenly. “That’s what started ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours looked over his shoulder to where Taisie
sat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dalhart,” said he, “there’s funny business. The
Rudabaugh gang is follering us, nigh as I can tell.
They allowed to stampede the herd and then jump what
was left of the camp.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But who shot?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d take my oath it was Dan McMasters, the man
we sent out of our camp. Well, he killed one of his
own men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The hell!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, he did. Look yon!” The great birds now
made a black blot on the grass. “That’s one of the
Rudabaugh men. McMasters killed him by mistake.
He was right in Miss Taisie’s camp.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jim,” said the cow hunter at last, “that Austin
gang don’t never mean fer no Del Sol herd never
to leave this country. Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the same reason they want that Burleson Lockhart
scrip. For the same reason they killed Burleson
Lockhart. Dalhart, them carpetbaggers have got a
big game on. All the state of Texas to steal—and
they’re going to steal it!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And McMasters got away again! I thought he was
our friend. We’re riding his horses and drinking his
coffee now. She don’t know that. Dalhart, ef ever a
girl needed a man to take care of her, yon’s one that
does. One man’s better’n twenty, with a woman. She
needs just one—and she ain’t got one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I got to go back. Come Sanchez,” he concluded.
“You’ll have to stay here and look out for
the camp, Dalhart. They might come back. Shoot
first!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Left in charge, Mr. Dalhart employed his own
methods. First he inquired of the cook for hot water,
got a tin pan of water on the base of the wagon tongue
and found a bit of yellow soap. Cleansing his dusty
face and hands the best he could, he employed the
very catholic beneficences of a split meal sack which
the cook also used as a towel. Then he prowled
among the bed rolls. After certain rummagings, he
presently emerged clad in a brand-new pair of the
light-colored trousers, with heavy stripes of black,
which then made Texan apotheosis of male splendor.
He even added a brilliant tie, which in good sooth represented
the heart hunger of Cinquo Centavos, and
almost his last dime. Dalhart was a ruthless man.
What he found to his notion in the several war bags
he took, trusting to be able to explain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oiled and curled as best might be in a cow camp,
with a final sweep into better order of his strong sunburned
beard, Mr. Dalhart at last walked straight across
to Taisie’s bivouac, whither she had withdrawn. Without
so much as by your leave, he ordered Taisie’s women
to go on away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m top rod here just now, Miss Lockhart,” said
he, “and I want to talk with you a little while. This
is my first chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl looked at him. She had been in tears. Her
nerves were going. She was no longer the daring
Taisie Lockhart, “<span class='it'>dulce ridentem .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. dulce loquentem,</span>”
like the Lalage of Horace of old, always ready to chat
and ready to laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Drive them away!” Her glance was toward the
distant row of solemn black birds, advancing, hopping
staring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dalhart dropped her tent flap into a screen. He
found a bundle and seated himself, not invited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Lockhart,” said he directly, “one way, I’m
only one of your hands. In Uvalde, you could find
out who I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose so. You’re on point? That means my
foreman thinks you know cows?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Now, Mr. Nabours and I been talking. We
think we’ve been jumped by the Sim Rudabaugh
bunch, of Austin. They don’t ever aim to let this herd
git north, Miss Lockhart. They aim to break it up
and git it headed west.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve got their own surveyors out—away west.
We seen four camps of surveyors in west there this
spring, where we was hunting strays. They’re locatin’
range by the hundreds of sections—waste land nobody
has wanted. They’re scrippin’ it, ma’am. They want
all the scrip they can git, and they done got it most all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke of certain things. In his mind were certain
other things. His bold eyes, virile, assertive, demanding,
never left the alluring picture that Taisie
Lockhart made for any man. She remained languid,
indifferent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father said Texas lands would go up. He
was laughed at. You knew him—my father?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No’m; I didn’t know him personal. But all Texas
knowed Colonel Burleson Lockhart fer a square man
and a big man. This state needs him now; it shore does.
We’ve got to clean up Austin, or Austin’s goin’ to
take all Texas away from the Texans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Them folks don’t want you to git the first herd
north, ma’am. They’ll drive that theirselves when they
git things all fixed fer hit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl buried her face in her hands again. Her
shoulders trembled. The night had left her much unnerved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Miss Taisie,” said the man’s voice, now
gentle. “Yore paw didn’t come back from up north.
Sim Rudabaugh did. He ain’t like us. He’s a heap
smarter’n us Texans. He’s seed more and been around
more. No tellin’ who’s in his gang. It takes a lot of
big men to swing as big a deal as he’s got in mind.
Now, there was Sher’f McMasters——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t! Please don’t! And—what is it that brings
you over here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, I won’t. I was only goin’ to say, hit all
works out fer to prove the general scheme Jim Nabours
and me both has told you about—Rudabaugh! That
man made his boast in Austin, ma’am, last year, atter
he come back from up north, he’d have the last Del
Sol cow. More! He said he was goin’ to ride up
to Del Sol and knock on yore front door!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?” She flashed a sudden glance of wrath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all. Rudabaugh played to break you first.
Then, when you hadn’t a way to turn—well——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Taisie Lockhart”—his voice now rang rather
true, very humble—“it’s bad, your lookout. You’ve
got all of us, yes; but like Jim said, twenty men ain’t
the pertection of one, fer a woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what is it that you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, I got to talk straight. Would you choose
to look up at me, please?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not raise her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I throwed in with this trail herd because I’d
saw you! I couldn’t turn back from goin’. I did
allow that when we’d made yore stake for you and
put you on yore feet independent, with all Del Sol and
every Texan back of you, why, then—when I couldn’t
take no advantage at all—then I was goin’ to tell
you I was goin’ to marry you. I thought by then
you’d be more used to seein’ me around.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silence. The ruddy crown of hair covered her hid
face, reddened with outraged blushes. She rose, started
away. He was at her side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Taisie, this raid has changed the whole world
in one night. It’s left you in danger. You don’t need
twenty men! You need one! The trail’s no place for
you, even married. But there’s a church at Fort Worth,
and a Methodist preacher. We’ll be there afore long.
That’s time for you to think it over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anastasie Lockhart broke into a sudden hysterical
laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it so funny, ma’am?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes!” she rejoined. “Fort Worth—that’s what
Jim advised, too. But first he said Austin. And it—it
was another man!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was Del Williams! Did you tell him——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve told him nothing! He has asked me nothing!
That’s nothing to be discussed by you or me at any
time! That will do!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I couldn’t help it—me lovin’ you the minute
I saw you, and follerin’ in because I couldn’t no ways
help it; and you needin’ just one such a man like me,
and all—and all——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice broke a bit under the blow his astonishing
male vanity had received. And who was she, an
orphan, to hold herself so high, when here was an
honest man, a Texan, like himself?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly he reached out a lean brown hand. Her
beauty was too much for him. The girl shrank, caught
a cupped hand against her temple, where lay still the
illicit kiss of the dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! No! You must not! No! I need some one,
yes. I do! But I can’t——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I kin wait, Miss Taisie. I allowed to wait till we’d
sold yore cows. I just thought things had broke so
maybe it’d be best if I didn’t wait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait!” was all she could say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Torn and unhappy, she bent her bright head once
more. He was man enough to go away. When he
was gone she reflected that he had been man enough
to come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And thereafter, in yet more wretched self-searching,
she reasoned that, after all, her fate now had cast her
into a world where a woman’s range of choice was
very narrow. After all, who was she, to ask the fulfillment
of the old dream of human happiness? She
sought comfort in philosophy. It is poor comfort for
a woman.</p>

to reassert the dominance of man and horse
over horned kine. Band joining band, converging,
controlled, the approaching dust clouds seemed
to show that ruin had not been complete; that the salvage
was larger than an inexperienced man would have
hoped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They got anyways a thousand head there,” said Dalhart
to the cook. He swung into saddle and rode out,
meeting Nabours, who came ahead, throwing up a hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop there, Dalhart! We got to tally in the findings.
Knot your rope. The boys’ll set ’em through.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two wheeled apart. Slowly the herd was
dribbled through between them, while the crude but
efficient art of handling cows went on. Each sat his
horse, facing the other. At each hundred he advanced
a knot under his thumb. When the last steer had passed
the two did not vary five head in the tally of the crowding
mob of cattle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eleven forty-six!” Nabours called. Dalhart nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t be sure. I made her eleven fifty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours grumbled. “It’s a start, no more. Go back
and help the other boys, Dalhart. There’s a big holding
yon way, about five mile toward the hills, besides
this one. Bring ’em in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Del Williams rode to the cook fire and had
a tin cup of coffee before he roped a fresh horse
and changed his saddle. Before leaving he turned to
Nabours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was any of our boys off north, about three mile,
Jim?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. The run was mostly east.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I seen sever’l men riding over towards the
hills where I was at, about sunup.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours growled his own suspicions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it might of been worse,” went on Williams.
“I seen fifty head piled in one arroyo. I don’t know
how many more there may be, further on; but the boys
are gethering a good many at the aidge of the pecan
bottoms where the creek runs. Golly-hemlock! We
ain’t half made the herd yet! The boys’ll be bringing
’em in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Sinker!” The foreman turned as the boy
horse wrangler came up, grinning diffidently. “Reg’lar
vaquero, eh, hide pants and all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Del said I could have his leggins,” the boy replied,
blushing vividly. “Now, my pants was tore, and that
there point man has got on my necktie. But please
kain’t I leave my horses and go help round up? My
horses won’t go fur.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huh! Want to break in and be a full cow hand,
eh? Your job’s on the remuda. But you can go ef you
don’t stay over a hour, like yore maw used to say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy sang very loud as he rode off. He hoped
she had seen the sprouting down on his cheek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shore know what I’ll do,” he said to himself.
“After this, nights, I’ll spread down, her side the camp.
I’ll sleep the neardest of anybody to her, so’s’t I kin
keep watch.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Dust and noise, harbingers of more cattle coming in,
twice more called Nabours and Dalhart to their tally
stands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, anyhow, we got over twenty-five hundred
head right now, and more in sight. Wait till Sinker
and Sanchez comes in with their drag. Ef we get over
thirty-five hunderd, that’s big enough for a herd to
drive good. What’s a few cows? We can comb the
whole country by to-morrer. They was too full to run
fur, but they fanned on us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours, under the influence of rest and coffee, began
to relax.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go over to Miss Taisie’s camp afore long,” said
he, “and tell her we ain’t broke yet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But say, Mr. Dalhart, tell me”—he cast a quizzical
look at the other’s rather spick-and-span appearance in
contrast to his own—“was you maybe going to church?
And you might let me know ef you put bear’s grease
on your whiskers too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dalhart, unmoved, stroked his luxuriant beard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nem-mind,” said he. “What’s a man withouten a
good baird? Kain’t no woman git away from a baird.
Now, I riz whiskers sence I was twenty, and I allus
noticed, ever I swep’ my baird acrost a gal’s face she
was shore mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ain’t got no gall hardly, have you?” rejoined
Jim Nabours. “Well, keep in mind there’s sever’l you
ain’t swep’ yet, ner ain’t apt to. Laigs is better’n
whiskers in the cow game. Keep yore eye on that
Sinker kid! He’ll make a cow hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to this prophecy of the old foreman, events bade
fair verification. All the remainder of the day the bed-ground
holding increased, and late in the afternoon
came a last drove of trotting longhorns, urged on by
the ambitious Cinquo, who had relieved faithful Sanchez,
found watching a considerable bunch grazing
while he himself awaited help.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re living up to them hair pants, son,” was the
foreman’s comment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The full complement of hands now was in camp. The
cook’s fire was glowing in its trench. Men were eating
three meals in one—beans, corn bread, molasses. They
talked, mouths full, contented. Not a man lost; maybe
not over ten per cent of the herd gone; they thought
the scrape well over. Even Nabours began to talk.
It was these last comers, however, who had brought the
biggest news.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was Sanchez found him,” broke in Cinquo in
his repeated explanation. “When I seen him, too, he
was daid, plumb daid. He ain’t none of our hands.
He got kotched in the run where they piled over the
bank.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That so, Sanchez? <span class='it'>Quien es?</span>” demanded Nabours
of the old Mexican.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Es verdad</span>,” replied Sanchez. “<span class='it'>Quien es? Yo no
sais.</span> Me, I dunno.” He shrugged a thin shoulder
indifferently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, he was a heavy-set man, with sort o’ red face,
maybe—sandy, anyhow—an’ he didn’t look like no real
cow hand.” Cinquo was more explicit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but I’ll bet he was a real cow thief,” growled
Nabours. “I’ll bet they was all around our camp, outside
the herd, last night. Fools for luck. Well, anyhow,
that makes two. Leave him lay where he’s at,
the damned thief! I only wish it was Sim Rudabaugh
or Mr. Dan McMasters!”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The losses, thanks to good cow work, bade fair to
be far less than the morning had promised. Nabours
thought next day the main herd could be pushed on
northward, slowly, while a few men were held back,
detailed for a last combing of the broken ground where
the run gradually had faded out. True, the herd might
tally out two or three hundred short—probably less
than that. But a cow was only a cow. Besides that,
a number of cows had come in that did not show the
Fishhook road brand, as Del Williams mentioned to
Nabours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean they don’t show it yet,” remarked that
veteran. “We’re working for a orphant. A cow is
only a cow, and these men in here wouldn’t mind ef
oncet they seen the orphant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I gathered them strays, er some,” broke in Cinquo.
“Er me an’ Sanchez did. We brung in Ol’ Alamo, that
big dun lead steer, an’ he brung in a lot o’ strays follerin’
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I got a damn good lead steer,” said Jim Nabours
solemnly, helping himself to coffee. “Sinker, you got
the nacherl makings of a cowman in you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tired men, taking without a murmur the added
sleeplessness of a full-night watch, made every safeguard
against a repetition of the late disaster. The
whole camp was sleepless. The cook kept his fire going
all the night and fed the men as now and then they
straggled in after the reassembled herd seemed safely
bedded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even at Taisie’s camp little sleep was known. Old
Anita nodded at her fire, but Milly was openly bellicose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah got a load in my gun fer dat triflin’ nigger Jim,
Miss Taisie,” she declared; “but Ah done put another
load down on top o’ hit. Ef ary man come snoopin’
roun’ yere in de dark agin Ah’m gwine to bust him
wide open—Ah suttenly will!”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='165' id='Page_165'></span><h1>CHAPTER XIX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE CATTLE RIEVER</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>O</span></span>F THE mysterious night marauders who—to
their own sorrow—had invaded the Del Sol
trail camp, no further trace was gained or
sought. They had vanished as though into thin air,
and left behind no more than surmise and suspicion.
To their dead, left on the field, no soldier’s honors
were accorded. The embittered cowmen let them lie
unburied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last gatherings of the scattered cattle having
been concluded with such subtractions and additions as
left old Jim Nabours not too ill satisfied, the great
caravan passed on to the northward, day by day, like
some vast millepede edging across the green surface of
the unbroken sod—cows, horses, carts, flanking riders
and keepers of the drag, all acting in their busy daily
drama as though on a stage set upon some vast moving
platform of the idle gods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps two hundred miles, as nearly as they could
guess at an unmapped and unfamiliar portion of their
own state—a land by no means yet redeemed from
savagery—still lay between them and the Red River,
the Rubicon of that day, the northern boundary of
Texas. Ten miles, twelve, once in a while fifteen miles
a day, the great herd grazed and strolled, north and yet
northward, unhurried by its guardians. Not so far
ahead, now, the wholly unsettled Indian Nations; and
at any time the chance of yet other depredations at the
hands of the determined white savages, whom they
dreaded more, and whose work, they felt sure, was not
yet done. As they approached the Red River, still unmolested,
their anxiety grew less. Could they have
seen into the unsettled land ahead of them it might well
have been more.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>A wild enough scene it was, that made by Rudabaugh
and his score of hard-bitten men in their own encampment
the first night after they themselves, pushing
swiftly on ahead of the Del Sol herd, which still made
their objective, pulled up on a bit of broken ground at
the naturally strategic point, the south bank of the
boundary river. For a time they roughly had known
or guessed what the trail herd had made in northering;
but their own forced march to the Red had gained them
nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was time, but the Del Sol herd had not appeared
or left any trace of its whereabouts. The men in the
rude bivouac—they had, in their haste, brought little
with them beyond what their saddle horses carried—began
to grumble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, how could I tell where they’d cross?” demanded
Sim Rudabaugh irritably, in answer to some
query. “They ought to cross here. This is right on
the old Whisky Trail, due north of Worth and Bolivar.
This is where Jess Chisholm used to cross when he
headed for the Canadian. That’s why I pushed on in
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, they didn’t. When they come to Bolivar last
week they must have swung up the Elm towards the
Spanish Fort, away in west. Good cowmen, they sure
are. Anyways, they’ve give us the slip.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve done nothing of the sort, Hanson,” retorted
the leader of the band. “There’s nobody gives
Sim Rudabaugh the slip.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, they’re north of the Red by now, like
enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you think it! The Red’s up, almost bank
full. No herd could ford it. Besides, even if they
was north of the Red, I reckon we know the Nations
better than they do, and can do more with the tribes.
If they get too far west they’ll hit the Comanches.
They’re not done with this trail yet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not that I want their damned cows now,” he added.
“We’d make more by going back to Palo Pinto and
working up the Brazos. But it’s not every herd that
has a hundred miles of scrip along with it in a box.
Once word comes down that a herd’s been sold at Abilene,
that scrip’ll go up, and go up fast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then besides!” grinned another man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then besides, yes! There never was a man
I hated worse than Burleson Lockhart. I’ll follow him
beyond the grave. Scrip I take from him now, or
from his family, is worth to me five times over, even
now he’s dead. And his daughter——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Followed some low obscenities from his followers
which did not abash the ruffian chief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Follow me and you’ll see yet,” he resumed. “I’ve
never yet quit. It’s easy to cross here if we have to,
and follow the Arbuckle Trail along the Washita. They
go twelve miles a day. We can go fifty. We can head
them when we please. I don’t intend that herd shall
ever see Abilene. No, nor I don’t aim that any man
on that herd’ll ever cross south of the Red again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cold-blooded ferocity of the man silenced his followers,
as always it did. They were all in one way or
another allied in a vast and unscrupulous border conspiracy
in a land to which little actual law yet had come.
The dullest of them knew that their heyday would be
brief, that events were moving fast. The swiftest horse
and the surest hand, the boldest and most ruthless
leadership—these were their hope. So they followed
Rudabaugh, the real leading spirit of the predacious
drifters who had seen in the disordered post-bellum political
conditions a vast opportunity for gain in a dulled
and disorganized land which did not yet suspect its own
riches. Rudabaugh had imagination, saw far ahead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I swear!” he broke out in one of the half-epileptic
fits of choler which sometimes marked him—he was
only a pirate of old reborn in the blood of the Civil War—“I
swear, some one’s got to suffer for some of this!
Last night four Indians rode right into our camp and
drove off six horses, and us needing every head we’ve
got. You all hear me, now! I swear I’m going to
shoot the first Indian I see north of the Red, I don’t
give a cuss what sort it is. We’ve gone palavering
along and letting a lot of longhorns shoot us up, and
then we have the Chickasaws run circles around us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first no one made reply, though a wild band they
made, such as no other land, no other conditions, could
have produced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean that, Sim?” asked one of them presently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know damned well I do,” rejoined the leader.
“You needn’t put it past me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Rudabaugh, subterranean politician, soldier of
fortune and renegade, no title or description could more
nicely have been fitted than the one word “ruffian.” Of
nondescript figure, perhaps of middle height, his body
as well as his face showed dissipation written indelibly
even for his age of forty-odd. His hair was dark, not
yet much thinned, and had a reddish cast as though reflected
from the deep floridity of his complexion. His
eyes also were hazel to the point of redness, smudged
and flecked in the pupils and evil to look at. His lips,
thick and astonishingly red, carried out the misprized
plan of his other features; he was coarse, common. Yet
the inordinate personal conceit, confidence, vanity of
the man had mirror in his clothing. Even on the trail
he might have been made up for the stage villain, with
the high boots, the velvet coat, the gaudy tie—in a borderland
where tie or collar was not customary. Excess
as much as daring was stamped on him, flamboyance,
aberration; yet even at middle age he by no means had
outgrown his earlier faith in his own invincibility with
women; nor had his other activities put woman from
his mind. His camp talk, not to be hinted, always gave
proof of that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To his unquestionable mental boldness, his daring
imagination in material matters, Rudabaugh added the
callous and ruthless indifference to the rights or sufferings
of others which often secures precedence in a band
of criminals. The bad eminence of Rudabaugh was
conceded as of merit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of Rudabaugh’s earlier and possibly criminal record
there was little known. Only a very few in his newly
chosen home knew he had been border outlaw for many
a year in a time when border outlaws really existed.
His field lay in the shady confines of a circle comprising
parts of Kansas, Missouri, Arkansas and the
unknown Indian Nations, always refuge for bad men
and those restive under the law. Leader of an organized
band of herd cutters on the Missouri-Arkansas border,
on the very earliest cattle drives, before the railroads
came, he had of late got visions of wider things.
He had followed south, back-trailing, to the origin of
the cows that first dribbled north. Credit him with conservative
business sense; he had caught scent of profits
to come in cows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Working from these beginnings, Rudabaugh later
had planned the most extensive range rieving ever
known. No better nor worse than many a later man
of large instincts and few principles who operated in
trail beef, he had found in politics the most powerful
agency possible in banditry. Once established as the
covert boss of a wide state machine, he did not lack followers.
If his activities and those of his like had much
to do with the sudden stiffening and increase of the
border constabulary of the Texas Rangers, his shrewd
notion of tremendous effects on Texas of any valid railroad
market also had weight in certain widespread
Texas circles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No doubt pique, baffled vanity, had much to do with
the presence of Rudabaugh’s gang this far north; but
as he had said just now, persistence was a characteristic
of the man. One thing he did not share with any man.
The image of Taisie Lockhart was in his blood.
Whether he planned to rob her and flout her, to rob her
and humble her, to rob her and then try to impress her
with some large gesture of generosity, who could tell
of a mind so insanely blurred and vague? At least, he
remained resolved to follow the Del Sol herd and the
Del Sol owner to the last mile of the trail unless sooner
satisfied in one or more purposes of his own. Another
quality of leadership—he could keep his own counsel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” Rudabaugh vouchsafed at last, helping himself
again to food at the fire, “they’ve only postponed
things. So far, they’ve got two of us, and one of them
Sam Barclay, my office deputy, and as good a man as
I had.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good on the books, maybe,” volunteered a voice,
“but no good as a cowman. The Del Sol men rid it
through and gathered, like enough, every cow except
what landed on top of Sam. And they never dug a
spade of dirt to cover him!” he added virtuously. “No
way to treat a man. Why, them people is outlaws!
And I’ll bet they’re crowing now over shooting Bentley!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re good cowmen,” commented Rudabaugh,
after a long time. “We can’t take any chances with
them, day or night. But I’ve got a few red friends
between here and the Canadian that’ll help pickle their
goose, I’m thinking. No white man yet ever scared
a Comanche very bad, least of all old Yellow Hand,
and I’ll bet he’s in the Nations right now. If we can
find his band and show them four thousand beeves and
two hundred picked horses I don’t think that herd’ll get
much further north. Talk of a Cherokee outlet west to
the buffalo lands—the Comanches’ll have something to
say about a Texas outlet north! I think I’ll show something
to our Del Sol friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You?” smiled a hearer. “Thought you said you’d
kill the first Indian you saw north of the Red!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I shall. I don’t throw a bluff and forget it.
That’s only my private matter. I’m going to kill that
Indian just as a matter of conscience.” He grinned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But before we move out of here,” he added, “we
ought to get some word from our man McMasters.
I’ve not seen hide or hair of him since he got run out
of the Del Sol camp and came pretty near getting shot.
He said he’d go on in alone and get the trunk out of
the girl’s tent. Well, he didn’t. Anyhow he disappeared.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s always disappearing,” remarked another man.
“He won’t work with us. I can’t line that fellow out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he told me he had to play both ends against
the middle,” grumbled Rudabaugh. “But he ought to
come in and report. I don’t mind a man being mysterious,
but I don’t want him too damned mysterious.
All I could do to trade with him, after that Ranger
run-in on the Del Sol, before he moved north with the
herd.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Had it been known, the bandit camp was not alone
beset with puzzles and problems. That very week, a
few nights earlier, in the encampment of the Del Sol
herd, old Anita at dawn brought to her mistress in her
own little tent a note, folded, addressed to no one, in
the handwriting of an educated man—a handwriting
she had never seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>El caballero vien’ aqui, señorita</span>,” said Anita calmly,
as she handed over the folded paper. “<span class='it'>Esta noche, heem
vien’ aqui.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He came to-night, Anita? Who came—what man?
And what is this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Yo no sais</span>,” replied Anita. “I dunno. He’s tall-a
man, <span class='it'>si</span>. He come-a my <span class='it'>carreta</span>, shake-a me soft, while
Sanchez he’s on da herd. He say, give-a dis to <span class='it'>la
Señorita</span>. But s’pose-a I make-a some holler, he goin’
choke-a me sure! I dunno some more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anita said nothing of a coin at that time tied in the
corner of her underskirt. Indeed, she thought it just
as well Sanchez should not know. As for her mistress,
she might do her own guessing; she could read Americano,
whereas, herself, Anita, could not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The communication was impersonal, detached, as
Anastasie Lockhart found. She hurried at once to her
trail boss; and if she had any guess in her own mind
she kept it there.</p>

<div class='blockquoter9'>

<p class='pindent'>Above Fort Worth village, head due north, to Bolivar.
Then don’t go on to the Station—swing northwest
up the Elm. Cross near the Spanish Fort. Feel
west then for the Beaver. Then run by the North Star
six hundred miles. Good water and grass. You can
make all crossings. Time about two months. Keep
west of the Whisky Trail. Herd cutters and thieves.
Watch out all the time for Indians.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Which, to a trail boss wholly without map, guide or
knowledge of the far and unknown country of the
north on ahead, must have seemed a godsend, even
lacking authenticity or origin.</p>

and, barring his travels under General Kirby
Smith, of small experience abroad, had been
in the habit of regarding his own horizon as sufficient.
He had yet to learn a thing or two to show him how
swiftly customs were changing in the Lone Star State.
In a general way he had heard of “river improvements,”
paid for in Texas land scrip, but as to details in that
new and pleasing form of plunder he had little knowledge
and no concern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Neither had he ever heard of cattle inspecting—yet
another form of graft devised in Austin, where more
was known or foreseen of the coming cattle hegira than
anywhere else in Texas. Furthest of all now from his
suspicions was the fact that a gentleman by name of
Jameson, well accredited in the current administration,
combined in his person the duties of president of a certain
“Land and Improvement Company” and of State
Cattle Inspector as well; and that this same Jameson
that spring was engaged with a small party of his own
on a wilderness trip, scouting up and down the Red, in
search of towhead snags that might be pulled, or of
passing cattle that might be inspected, to the glory of
God, as the first Spanish improvers and inspectors of
that country once would have phrased it. Commerce
sometimes becomes religion, as religion sometimes becomes
war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There always lacked explicitness in the story of the
Del Sol crossing of the Red River. Jameson—owner
of fat contracts in river improvements and cattle inspector
by the grace of the carpetbag imperator at
Austin—could bring no imposing narrative of himself
and his deeds in connection with the advent of this apparition
of thousands of wild long-horned kine, handled
by a concourse of wild men, which one day broke out
of the blackjacks near his camp. That was the Del Sol
herd; but Jameson, being only a cattle inspector, could
not be supposed to notice the T. L. and Fishhook brand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Nabours himself, riding ahead to scout the
approach to the high south bank, who had stumbled
across the new camp of the inspector and his men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How, friend?” the herd foreman saluted. Jameson
came forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“North”—succinctly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“North? Across the river? That’s the Indian
country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours grinned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shore it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“North? But who are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sincet you ask me, friend, I’m foreman of the Fishhook,
four thousand head, bound for Aberlene, wherever
in hell that is. You ever done hear tell of the old
Chisholm road?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Chisholm Trail? Why, that’s away in east.
He crossed either at Colbert’s or at the Red Station—the
Station’s usual. You’re off your road forty or
fifty miles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I?” said Jim Nabours innocently. “Sho!
That’s too bad! Well, maybe we can sort of cut in on
the trail north of here somewheres, huh? I got a high-trained
old oxen, name of Alamo, a old mossy horn
raised by General Santy Anny, and he allows we cross
in here somewheres. He knows where at’s Aberlene.
Do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jameson frowned at levity. Then suddenly his chest
swelled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, lucky enough you happened to hit my camp,”
said he. “You broke in west, here, to escape the law!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Law? What law?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you’re trying to move cows across the Red,
off the soil of Texas, and not have the herd inspected.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Inspected? We done inspected ’em several times.
They’re all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know perfectly well what I mean. The law
provides a fee for the proper inspection of all cattle
moving off their own range—checking up and recording
the brands, looking to see they’re all in the same
road brand, accounting for strays, and so forth. Looks
to me like you are trying to evade the fees. Well, I’m
the state inspector for this district.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That so? You aim to collect something?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, certainly. I’ve got to look over your herd before
you cross; that’s my duty. I may have to turn
you downstream, to the regular crossing. You don’t
belong in here, and you know it. Where’s your herd?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Back below the blackjacks, on the Elm,” responded
Nabours promptly, a gleam in his gray eye that the
other did not note. “How’d it do for you to ride back
with me and have a look at our outfit where the herd
is made?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jameson turned back to his own men, a half dozen
ague-smitten whites, and ordered his horse brought up.
When he mounted to ride south with the innocent
stranger of the trail he made one of the capital errors
of his career in the new country of Texas, and one
which he never saw fit to describe in full to his chief,
Rudabaugh, when at last he had reached the latter in
his own camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a more open valley they came in sight of the great
T. L. herd, scattered over two miles of country, grazing
or lying at rest. A dozen riders lolled, leg over
saddle horn, themselves a-doze, waiting for the foreman’s
return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ain’t it purty?” said Nabours, the real cowman’s
love of cows in his speech. And it was a noble sight,
this wild picture in a wild land. Any way one looked
there was no edge to the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Jameson was more businesslike.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, now,” said he, “it is a good bunch. How
many did you say you had?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thirty-eight hunderd and sixty-five, we made our
last tally,” answered the T. L. foreman, the glint again
in his eye. “Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, now, I never want to make bother for a good
cowman,” Jameson answered. “It’s true you’re off
your course, but maybe that’s natural. I’ll just take
your own count and let you go. You can pay me the
fee and I’ll not bother you any more at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t even ride in amongst the herd to look at the
brands, nor nothing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, no! What’s the use? I can trust men like
you. Just pay me the fee and let her rip.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how much is the fee, Mister Inspector?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing at all, you might say—two bits a head.
Taking your own count—let’s see; call it thirty-six
hundred head for easy figuring. Divide her by four.
Nine’s a nine and naught’s a naught—she comes to
nine hundred dollars. Ought to be a cold thousand; but
as I said, that’s nothing amongst men like us. Give
me that and I’ll let you go and never take another
look. I’ll trust a man like you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim Nabours had played in many a game where one
does not display his emotions. He set his face now,
almost suppressing the dull red that took over the gray
glint of his eye. The sum of nine hundred dollars was
the same as nine million to him. There was not a hundred
dollars, even of Mexican make, in all the convoy,
and he knew that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like you say, that’s little enough,” said he. “Two
bits a throw ain’t worth talking over, not amongst men
like us. But just for sake of friendship, let’s ride on
over to our wagon and have a cup of coffee—you orto
see how pore it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke with a finality hard to evade. The other
rode alongside. A quarter of a mile, and Nabours
threw up his hand. Del Williams swung away from
his stand and came up at a gallop. Nabours had loosed
his rope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Del,” said he, “this is Mr.—I dunno.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jameson; Henry D. Jameson, of Austin, gentlemen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And he says he’s the cattle inspector on the Red.
It costs us two bits a head to cross the river, Del. It
ain’t much, only nine hunderd dollars. And so——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nine hun——” But Del Williams did not finish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rope which Jim Nabours idly had uncoiled suddenly
shot out behind him with a quick side flirt. It
settled fair around the neck of Henry D. Jameson, the
first cattle inspector Texas ever knew. The next instant
the aforesaid Henry D. Jameson was out of his saddle,
his hands clawing grass as he slid along the ground,
choking very rapidly. Del Williams on chance laid his
own rope on the neck of the Jameson horse, which
seemed a good one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You damn thief! You low-down, lying son of a
’niquity, you!” The wrath of Jim Nabours, smoldering
a half hour, now flamed. His tongue waxed unprintable
while in two composite languages of the
Southwest he cursed Henry D. Jameson till his own
face was as red as that of his victim was empurpled.
Del Williams, gun in hand, followed close, his cue
obvious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Git up, damn you!” at length croaked the foreman.
“You stand up! You’ll charge Texas men for wetting
their girths in a Texas river, will you? Pay you nine
hunderd dollars? We’ll see you and all Austin in hell
before we’ll pay you a damned cent. Come on now
quiet, or we’ll leave you plumb quiet. Come along!
It’s lucky we ain’t got no fire lit or I’d run a Fishhook
on you for luck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t shoot him, Del. But what’ll we do with this,
now we got it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men on guard saw the sudden commotion. A
half dozen came, jerking up, ropes a-swing, eager. A
vast Cossack laughter rose when Nabours explained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Prop up a cart tongue!” called Len Hersey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the victim now noted the sudden apparition of a
slender figure astride a singular white-hipped horse,
coming up at a gallop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s this, men?” demanded Taisie. “What are
you doing there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ma’am,” said Jim Nabours, now more calm, “we
ain’t doing nothing much. We’re just going to hang
a damned thief that wants to colleck two bits a head on
our cows for swimming the Red River.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what—but why?” Taisie’s own brow puckered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jameson found speech, even in his surprise, for now
he saw this was no slender boy at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madam,” said he, a noose lying on his shoulder and
one hand at it, “these men have resisted the law. I am
the lawful inspector for this district. I have come here
in the pursuit of my duty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve got a dangerous duty,” said Taisie Lockhart
straitly. Her own soul was Texan. “Inspect us,
charge us—for what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jameson tried to explain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shut up! We’re wasting time!” broke in Nabours,
jerking the rope. “We ain’t got nine hunderd dollars;
and if we had we wouldn’t give you nor no man a
copper cent to ride this range ary way we like.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’ll we do with him, boys?” He turned again
to his men. “Ef we let him go he may start something.
Hyenuses runs in bunches. What’ll we do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a question!” scoffed Dalhart. Len Hersey
again named the wagon tongue; but Taisie Lockhart
raised a hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!” she called. “No! Wait!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can’t wait, ma’am,” said Nabours. “We’re
wasting time. The Red’s running full now and maybe
raising every hour for all we know. We can’t wait
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then—tie him and leave him!” suddenly spoke the
saddle Portia. “Leave him here—his friends may find
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aw, hell!” said a voice. It was that of Cinquo
Centavos, the horse herd. Nabours turned to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sinker, go get a couple of hobbles.” The boy
rode off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you going to do to me?” began Jameson.
“I warn you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t warn us none!” rejoined Nabours. “Ef you
do we’ll kill you. Keep your mouth shut! The girl’s
the only thing saved you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yon’s a nice cactus stand, boys,” he resumed, his
face relaxing as he looked around. “Hog-tie him and
throw him in the cactus, deep as you can. Ef he tries
to get out plug him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s yore sentence, Mister Cow Inspector, and it
looks like God has had mercy on yore soul. Ef you
get out don’t try charging no more Texas men for
riding over the free lands. They won’t have it. Quick,
boys! Don’t waste no more time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Portia rode away, not knowing exactly how far her
authority really would go with her wild crew. As she
passed, her ears were assailed with the supplications of
Henry D. Jameson, bound hand and foot and exceedingly
full of cactus spines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whereby may be seen the very natural reason for
his enmity and his desire for revenge when he was
found the next day by his own men. He voiced the
same emotions, though he did not give full details,
when he joined the freebooter camp of Rudabaugh, far
to the east, when later he had found those friends.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE RUBICON</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>N</span></span>OW it was noon of the next day. The cattle
had been pushed close to the south bank of the
great mysterious river. The foreman sat with
his employer on the steep crest of the ravine selected as
the take-off for the ford. A bridge had never been, a
ferry no man had dreamed of here. Flowed only the
wide sweep of tawny waters, boiling and fretting, bearing
rape of far-off flats, tree trunks rolling and dipping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Red was up! This was an ominous and savage
scene, and one to depress even the boldest heart; for
over this flood must pass each horned head ever to find
a market in the north.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Anastasie Lockhart, whitely looking out over the
mad waters, this seemed the very end. It did not appear
possible to cross. It never would have seemed possible
to Nabours had he been of longer trail experience or
less desperate in view of other dangers which might
come again if they tarried here indefinitely. A freshet
of less extent later was known to hold back a hundred
thousand cows. But Jim Nabours now had made up
his mind to take a chance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to throw the carts over first, ma’am,”
said he. “Then I’ll cross the cows. I’m going to hold
the horses back this time. Then, after the last head’s
over, a lot of us’ll cross back after you. We’ll know
the channel and the bars better then. Don’t you be
a-scared. We’ll get you over somehow. That’s how I
got it figgered, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s up, Jim,” said Taisie quietly. She was trying
her very best to be brave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yep, some. But she’s fell a foot since last night.
She shows a bar, a quarter below, and a low flat that
edges in shaller on the fur side. I think that’s the real
bank, and like enough hard footing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We could wait a week, maybe. She might raise
and she might fall. We’ll soon know how deep she is.
I don’t reckon she’s not over two-three hunderd yards
actual swimming—I can’t tell. I don’t want to wait
here. You know why.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can we make it, Jim?” asked the girl soberly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think we can, ma’am,” said the old foreman as
quietly. “Ef I didn’t, do you s’pose I’d throw ’em in?
She has been crossed by cows, down below, for the
Arkansaw market. Yore own paw has crossed her.
Can’t we? If Jess Chisholm, or any of the Chickasaw
whisky runners, could cross her with stock so can we.
Huh? I’m a good cowman, ma’am, and I got the best
bunch of hands ever pushed a foot in a stur’p.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taisie Lockhart turned on him the sober gaze of her
steady eyes, but made no reply at the time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jim!” Suddenly she turned on him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ma’am?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jim! I’ve got no one else—I’ve got to come to you.
Cal Dalhart asked me to marry him—again, to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you didn’t, and you can’t. The last minister
was at Forth Worth. There’s others of the same mind,
Taisie. Has Del Williams spoke? Dalhart’s lied.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Del!” said she. “So quiet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he done spoke to me more’n oncet. He allows,
and so do I, that no man had orto talk a word to you
about no such thing until after he ain’t working for you
no more. That’s until after Aberlene. That’s the way
Del put it. I liked it of him. Cal Dalhart’s a leetle
brash, to my notion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do women always make trouble, Jim? I’m
making trouble right here. I’ve made it from the
start.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, ma’am, Eve, she begun it right at the real
start. They always done so, since. I got to pass word
again there can’t be no courting on the Fishhook herd,
not till after Aberlene, ma’am. I told you to get married
and go back home; but you wouldn’t. Now, see
where you are! Time enough for marrying and giving
in marriage, ma’am, ef we ever get to Aberlene. Ef
we don’t we’ll not need study about that nohow. Huh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be good, Jim,” said Taisie, smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when once more she looked at the river she did
not hope ever to see Abilene. She classed herself now
as the last of the Texas Lockharts. She would not
disgrace the name.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Ticklish work it was, and asking alike resource and
courage; but methodically as though they had done
nothing else in all their lives, the men of Del Sol went
about it now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under Nabours’ direction they got together long
logs of cottonwood drift, dragging them in at the ends
of their lariats, cowman fashion. Taking the cook
cart for their first experiment, they lashed some of the
longer logs under the body, unbolting the tongue. The
clumsy vehicle was heavily loaded. How much of
swimming water there would be none could tell; but
their philosophy was wholly empirical. Nabours turned
back at the edge of the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep right after me, men, and keep her a-coming!”
he called to the riders who now were in readiness to
take the water. “Don’t try to hold her against the current.
Let her slide down, and keep your horses swimming.
Ef we make that bar we’re all right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You, Del, go upstream in front—Cal, get in front
below. You’ve got the hind rope upstream, Len, and
Sanchez, you go downstream. Keep her going just like
it was on the ground. She’d orto float some anyway.
Come on now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spurred into the rolling discolored stream. His
horse, snorting and trembling even at the brink, within
five yards of the steep bank was in swimming water;
but he headed straight across, gallantly, though carried
steadily downstream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stripped to their underclothing, and minus their
pistol belts, the men spurred in. With a sudden plunge
the unwieldy craft took the water at the rear of the
horsemen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By golly, she floats!” called out a voice on the shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cal Dalhart flung up a hand with a yell. Old Sanchez
crossed himself industriously. But all four of the
horses, muzzles flat and nostrils blowing, followed as
best they could the leader who swam ahead, his saddle
horn still showing high. That it was all a mad endeavor,
no sane man could have doubted. But Providence
was ever kind to men who dare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those remaining on shore watched the strange procession
in absolute silence. Taisie covered her eyes.
The plan of the crossing had much good judgment in
it, but only extreme good fortune ever could give it
success. By some kind impulse of its own, the current
began to carry the clumsy contrivance toward the head
of the sand bar at midstream, scarcely more than visible
above the surface, but offering great hope to the swimming
horses. The silent watchers at last saw the horse
of the leader plunge upwards and get footing. The
two lead horses followed, all of them still belly deep.
The length of the reatas of the rear men allowed them
also to get footing while the great wheels of the cart,
hanging below the edges of the raft, remained floating
free. The power of five horses, even with soft footing
under them, finally enabled the men to drag it to floating
water beyond the head of the bar. To their relief
it found temporary anchorage when the wheels caught
bottom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours sat his half-submerged horse, looking
studiously out across the remaining waterway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold on here, boys, till I try her out,” he commanded.
“I think from here acrost she’s sorter flat.
Ef she won’t float the cart, cut out the logs, splice your
ropes and fetch one on acrost to me so we can yank
her through.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They got floatage for a little way out from the bar,
but presently the raft became a liability and not an
asset for them. They cut log after log free and let it
run downstream. Nabours’ horse was no more than
belly deep ahead of them. Four hide reatas, each of
forty feet and all spliced, at last gave them connection
with the solid shore. With a great shout they yanked
the first cart up the farther bank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours rode up to the front of his amphibious
vehicle and disclosed Buck, the negro cook, who had
been praying on the floor of the cart, up to his knees
in water part of the time, and now still of grayish complexion
under his natural pigmentation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter with you, boy?” he demanded.
“Climb down out of there, now, and get things ready
for a meal against we get the next cart acrost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was necessary for the five men to recross the river.
After a long study of both shores for a take-off, they
concluded to wade down to the head of the bar, cross
the swimming water from that point, and to land below
the original take-off on the south shore, at a point
where the high bank flattened. Two of the five men
knew almost nothing of swimming. Each man put his
life upon the strength and courage of his horse. Their
work was there and it had to be done. They eased their
mounts by slipping out of saddle, swimming downstream
and taking tow, one hand clinging to a saddle
thong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is enough to say that they did make the recrossing.
Taking advantage of the rebound of the current from
the bar, they found footing on the south bank perhaps
a quarter of a mile below the original take-off. Wet,
half-naked, they all whooped on up to the ford head,
where all the remainder of their company were huddled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s all right, Miss Taisie!” yelled out Nabours.
“We can do it plumb easy. You stay here where you
are. I’m going to put Milly and Anita in the next cart.
We’ll swim you over special, on horseback. That’s a
heap safer’n any boat. All you got to do is just to set
still on your horse and let him alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The delay with the second cart was but short. Old
Milly, on her knees in the sand hysterically supplicating
her deity, was forcibly assisted to the seat where already
Anita, patiently telling her beads, was seated, a-waiting
fate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again they pushed out; once more they made the
head of the bar; and this time, with even less difficulty
than at first, finished the second half of the crossing.
For the second time, wet to the skin, the men crossed
back, cursing the luck which had brought them here to
meet high water, but as yet meeting with no mishap.
Nabours looked dubiously at the horses, which had
made the crossing twice. The men refreshed themselves
with hot coffee and a hurried bite to eat. The
farther camp now was made, so there would be coffee
at each end of the crossing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But now they must address themselves to the tremendous
experiment of crossing the herd. True, these
had had swimming water at the Colorado, the Brazos,
the Trinity; but in each case the farther shore was well
in view of the take-off and the swimming channel narrow.
What would the cattle do now, facing a moving
sea of roily water?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ready with them fresh horses, men!” called Nabours.
“Point the herd in here. Make them take
water just back of me, and throw ’em in spreaded. All
of you act just like it was on the ground. Take your
points, you, Cal and Del! All you swings, ride right
above and below just like you was on the trail. They’ll
swing down plenty in the current. Take it easy and
quiet. If any of you gets scared them cows’ll be scared
too. Ef they begin to mill it’ll be hell for every one of
us; so keep ’em spread out and moving. Here’s where
we make a cap or shore spoil a coonskin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With cracking of horns and tossing of heads, the
front of the herd came shuffling down the shallow draw
to the edge of the water, led by a few lank and rangy
steers, old Alamo, the accepted lead steer, still in front.
They were creatures alert and wise as deer, true longhorn
stock of the lower range. Something of the wild
instinct blended with their recent practical education.
Crowded by the numbers pushed against them from the
rear, old Alamo shook his head for half an instant, then
bent his knees and plunged in, following the swimming
horse on ahead. Some men still rode the same mounts.
Now and then a man lightened ship, by slipping out of
saddle for a time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One by one, by fives and tens and scores, the other
cattle followed the lead thus established. The inshore
leg of the long moving U passed out and down, the
cattle swimming steadily, gently, their muzzles level,
their tails spread. They knew well enough where they
were to land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stream of the herd seemed almost endless, but
when the great U once was established—the cattle finding
footing on the bar at midstream and wading over
the shallows beyond—the line of action was perfectly
apparent to every animal as it was pushed up to the
river brink. They took the water as had those before
them, and formed a continuous living line across the
river. It was a magnificent spectacle. It was a triumph
of personal courage combined with knowledge of the
art of cows. But surely fate aided in this first and
riskiest crossing of the Red by any herd passing northbound
to the rails.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was little need of guidance after the first of
the herd had reached the bar in midstream, and here
some of the riders turned back to the south shore,
riding up to the take-off. Again and again they took
the water below the swimming stream of cattle. They
could see the long line of the cattle elevate itself like a
great parti-colored snake at the bar, thence writhing
along as though upon the ground, and fully visible as
it topped the farther shore. The great adventure
seemed in a fair way to conclude itself upon the side of
courage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old Del Sol foreman was a good cowman, as
good as the next, and there were few phenomena in
the trade of cows with which he was not familiar. One
might have seen him all that day looking up anxiously
at the sky. The heavens were dull and overcast; a bad
day to put cattle at a ford. Rain portended; for long
there was no glimpse of the sun. But had there been
any glimpse of the sun the veteran foreman would never
have pushed his herd into the river late in the afternoon,
for a reason which any trail man would have
understood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that point the river ran almost north and south,
so that the course of the cattle was almost westward.
In the evening any rays of the sun would lie like a path
across the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But cattle will not swim into the sun. No good trail
boss ever undertook to cross a herd into a sunset. The
one hope of Nabours was in a continuous cloudiness of
the evening sky. He did not want the sun to shine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But now, as he turned his own anxious face toward
the west, he saw a greater definition of the piling clouds.
The lower edge of yonder heavy bank was tinged with
silver. By and by the sun would drop through. Then
its light would lie across the water, straight into the
eyes of the swimming cattle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sudden oath of old Jim Nabours had many factors
in it—pity for what he knew might happen, regret
for his own hastiness, apprehension for the property
which was not his, resentment at what seemed to him
an unjust fate and a poor reward for the courage which
his men had shown. Nature, always merciless, now
seemed mockingly vindictive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No act of man could affect that which was now to
happen. The almost level rays of the sun did fling their
burnished path across the yellow waters. It was cast
straight into the eyes of the drag, some three or four
hundred animals which had not yet crossed the swimming
channel. It half blinded for a moment even the
eyes of the men. A floating log came down among
them, caught the upper cattle, swung crosswise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The line broke. There was a great uptossing of
horns, a jumbling of shoulders as some animals attempted
to find floatage on the backs of others. The
spaces were lost, the bodies were packed together in a
mass, struggling, moaning—and steadily passing downstream.
The dreaded swimming mill was on!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little enough could the bravest or most skilled men
do now. What men could do, the two riders now caught
in the mill attempted. They did not try to swim free
of the mass, but drove into it, attempting to break and
point out the mill so that the cattle would find footing
somewhere below. At times the head and shoulders of
their ponies showed, climbing upon the shoulders of
the swimming cattle, the men beating with their quirts,
kicking, urging, shouting. But the cattle would not
swim into the sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those upon the nearer shore heard the sound of the
rush of waters and a combined low moan, indescribable.
It was hopeless. Not the best efforts of the entire company
could have broken that fatal midstream mêlée.
As though in a dream, Taisie Lockhart, wringing her
hands, stood dumb and saw go forward one of the
sudden tragedies of the trail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leave them go, men! Come back! We can’t save
them now! Come on out!” Nabours ordered back his
men on the farther side of the bar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stood looking at the moving mass which made
a dark blot below the bar, where the current once more
headed for the east. Neither head of horse nor man
long showed above the floating island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was Dan and Billy,” said Jim Nabours, the
first tears in his eyes any man had seen there. “I done
it my own self! Look at that sun!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was dusk when he and half a dozen of his best
men once more rode up the shore to the take-off. Taisie
met him, sobbing unreservedly. The veteran herdsman
himself could not speak.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='194' id='Page_194'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>“TILL ABILENE”</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>“W</span></span>E can’t do nothing more to-night.” Nabours
had joined his companions at the fire.
“Find a critter if you can, and kill it
for supper,” he added, turning to Cinquo, who
white and silent, had stood at the side of his mistress
through all the late tragic scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stripped, wet and cold, the trail men sat in silence.
The sound of a distant shot in the brush promised them
food—a straggling yearling from the drag which had
been lost among the willows; but they were so dulled
with fatigue, regret, sorrow, that they hardly would
have cooked for themselves had not Taisie and Cinquo
taken a hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night settled down with a certain chill along the
water’s edge. The darkness held unusual terrors for
the lone girl. Suddenly she dropped her face in her
hands, huddling against the wet shoulder of the man
who came nearest to being her protector.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jim! Jim!” she sobbed. “Take care of me! I
am scared!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So’m I scared, Miss Taisie,” rejoined Jim Nabours
truthfully. “Lord ha’ mercy on me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men of Del Sol slept ill enough, close to the
embers of their fire. Cinquo’s saddle blankets, partly
dry at least, he gave to their mistress, for whom he had
made a bower somewhat apart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy was the first to move in the foggy dawn
and to find his horse. He rode down the river bank
in the direction of the last tinkling of the lead mare’s
bell. He was gone for the best part of an hour before
he brought up the remuda. By that time the other men
had rebuilt their wastrel fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something seemed on Cinquo’s mind. He approached
Nabours, who stood apart, moody and depressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Jim,” said he, “I met a man down there, and
he was riding a blue-crane Fishhook horse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The foreman turned to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are sure?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I kin read a brand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he say anything to you? What?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was rather quiet. He was a tall man with a
little mustache and a gray hat. He told me not to tell
you who he was—and I hain’t told you. He told me
he seen the place where the mill landed last night.
There’s dead cows all along this side the river, and
besides was two dead men—that was Bill and Dan.
He said he pulled them out and covered up their faces.
He said he knew a better crossing down below, and he
wished we’d of knowed where it was at. Then he rid
back down the river, when he left.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A damn good thing he did!” said the trail boss.
“Ain’t I had enough without that set of thieves?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eat, men,” he added to the half-clad group of stiffened
men around the fire. “We have got work to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made no comment on the news the boy had
brought, but led the way. With knives and sharpened
sticks, they dug two graves in the sand; stood with hats
off for a little time, silent. Some men began to kick
dirt in on top of two saddle blankets. They rode away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the draggled bivouac at the head of the crossing
there remained then only the mistress of Del Sol and
the boy Cinquo, who had been ordered to remain. The
latter engaged himself in broiling some pieces of meat
at the fire, not for himself. His divinity came out at
last, having made such toilet as she could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are the other men?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re down a-burying Dan and Bill, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The not infrequent tears came again to Taisie Lockhart’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They come ashore nigh a mile below here, a man
told me. He come up from down the river when I was
down after the horses. A tall young fellow he was,
with a dark mustache. He told me he had found where
the mill landed, and the boys and everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t know who he was?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know he was a-riding a Fishhook horse, ma’am.
I’ve saw him afore, yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taisie Lockheart turned quickly away, with no reply.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” began Nabours surlily, without much speech
to his mistress or to any one of the company, “we’ve
got to get the horses acrost. Throw them in, Sinker;
drive that old gray mare in first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t have to drive her in; she’ll foller me,” replied
the boy. “I ain’t going to let nobody point her
lead for me and my remuder. They know me. Old
Suze, she’ll foller right in after me. Ef you can swim
it, I kin. Besides, she’s six inches lower than she was
last night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huh, six inches would do a heap o’ good out there,
wouldn’t it?” grumbled Nabours. “You ain’t running
this herd.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but I’m running the remuder,” said the boy
stoutly. His eyes began to fill with tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, get in then!” The trail boss looked at
him kindly, his own eyes none too dry. “There’s only
one way to make a cow hand. If he lives he lives!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>None the less, he and his two lead men flanked the
horse herd close behind the plucky boy when he spurred
in ahead, followed by the bell mare and the rest of the
horse band. The course was much as it had been with
the cattle. The horses swam strongly and confidently
and in due time made the head of the bar, which now
was more exposed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take ’em on out now, Sinker; it’s safe from here
on. We’ve got to go back oncet more, to get the boss.
Come on, you, Cal and Del. This is the last trip.
Hurry! She’ll be scared there by herself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the primitive brain of the old Texan, who trusted
nothing so much as a horse, the uncertain raftage of
the previous day had made the carts seem riskier than
the back of a swimming horse. For that reason he had
decreed that Taisie Lockhart should remain until the
very last. His plan now was revealed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Taisie,” said he, when at length he had regained
the take-off, “you’ve seen us all cross there time
and again. It’s perfectly safe for a good swimming
horse like yours. I’m a-going to cross you like we
done everything else. I’m a-going on ahead my own
self, and put Del and Cal above and below you, with
ropes to your saddle, so’s to steady you if anything
should happen. There ain’t no cows now. Just keep
your hands off your bridle; don’t try to guide your
horse none at all. You mustn’t look down at the water,
for if you do you think you are going downstream,
when you ain’t. Just you look on ahead, right at the
top of my hat; then you’ll be perfectly safe. Us men
ain’t going to let nothing happen to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl was pale, but the family courage and the
traditions of the border were her own. She got into
saddle without a word and spurred the snorting Blancocito
directly into the curling waters when Nabours
gave the word. It seemed to her to be facing death.
She resigned her soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But suddenly she felt under her a certain lightness,
accompanied with a throbbing vibration—movement,
progress. She knew her horse was swimming. On
ahead, Jim Nabours sat as though upon the surface of
the tawny water, the top of his saddle cantle showing
over the streaming tail of his horse, which swam on,
steadily and confidently, after the gallant fashion of the
Texas strain. She looked right and left. Two other
men were advancing also strangely over the water, only
the upper portion of their bodies visible. It was like
some fantastic dream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In absolute silence they crossed the swimming channel,
saw the face of the sand bar come nearer, as though
it were approaching upstream across the swirling flood.
Fifty yards, thirty yards, twenty yards—they would be
safe! And then came one more jest of the immortal
gods! It was an accident made more readily possible
by the mistaken attempt of using guide ropes on a
swimming horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A great tree, uprooted somewhere unknown miles to
the westward, came rolling and dipping its snaggled
branches. The men saw it perfectly well, and coolly
made ready to meet the danger, each man with hand
at his reata.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Impossible to predict the freak of the changing current!
A bared root of the tree caught at the edge of
the bar. The heavy trunk swung down toward Dalhart,
who had the upstream side. Nabours was now
ahead, on the bar. His back was turned. He was
looking curiously at the man they all had seen approaching
through the shallow water from the farther bank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cool-headed plainsman, Dalhart, gave length to
his rope, flipped it to free it of the one menace, an
upstanding snag which would not allow the rope to
clear. But in some way, no one could tell how, a roll
of the menacing leviathan threw the snag a little
higher. The drag of the rope in the water did the rest.
The rope fouled on the snag. As a consequence, the
horse of Taisie was drawn directly in front of the log
as it swept downstream. A scream, shouts. In a flash
the girl’s pony was trying to get his forelegs over the
log. The girl herself, thrown or slipping out of the saddle,
was in the water; and all of them, horses, riders,
with the giant log, were steadily swept down below the
head of the bar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sudden disaster concentrated all the world into
an immediate surface of eddying, onward water, coffee
colored, and the narrow strip of wet sand edging it.
The scene was not fifty feet across, so near were the
swimmers to the one trace of land. Beyond that limit,
for the participants existed no horizon and no use for
eye or ear. Nabours had some indefinite, vague sense
that the wet noise of a horse’s advance through the
shallow back of him was close, now directly at his
back; but to turn his head from the tragedy at his hand
was not possible as even an instant’s thought; so that
when the hurrying horseman appeared at his side, as
though dropped from the sky, it seemed quite natural
enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The quick cast of his own rope fell short from where
he sat his horse, with footing on the bar. Those in the
water had only their own powers now. There was no
conscious plan on Taisie Lockhart’s part, or that of the
two swimming men; no one could tell how it all had
happened, or what now must happen. But suddenly
the girl felt herself caught in the strong grasp of Del
Williams, himself dismounted, swimming. He dragged
her into the swinging branches—across them. By
then Dalhart’s rope was free, and Taisie’s pony, dropping
back from its struggle to surmount the log, also
was free, as the ponderous tree trunk swept on by. So
by renewed freak of fortune, all three of the horses
made the edge of the bar before it was too late. By this
very fact the lives of those caught in the current were
set in more instant danger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It all was in silence. No one called for aid, supplicated;
no one shouted advice, instruction; there was
not a sound to the advance of death. Nabours, perhaps,
held his breath thrice the usual space as he jerked
in his rope, cast again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The loop fell wide, sank; but Williams missed it,
was swept down, encumbered by the current, here very
strong in its rebound. The water had cut off the slope
of the bar a few yards below and left a gouged channel,
sharp, swift. But Dalhart’s hand fell on the loop.
With a groan, unable to cast again for the white face
of the girl, Nabours returned, whirling his horse, gathering
slack, feeling his whole life a failure now, since
he had saved only a man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now into his consciousness came identification of
the horseman who had plunged across the shallows
to the harder footing of the bar, well trampled by the
cattle which had passed. Of course, vaguely, generally,
he had known at first loose sight that it was not any of
his own men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was McMasters, his pistol belt wrapped around
his saddle horn, his coat off and held under a leg, his
reata free. He pushed down the bar—off the bar; but
before his horse swam, a whirling back cast had spread
the loop over the heads of the two swimmers, who,
plainly, never could have made the bar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He would have dragged them out by the neck,
choked, yea or nay, had his horse held footing. As it
was, he was the one of the three who had some plus
power, even as his horse swam. With a desperate
struggle the gallant brute got his feet on holding
ground, floundered out, up. By then the loop had narrowed
to the hondo. But the bit of rawhide there was
gripped in Del Williams’ clutch. He still held in his
other arm the heavy drag of the girl’s body. He did
not know whether or not her eyes were closed; hoped
only he had been able to keep her face high.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that, it was quick, simple, silent. The essential
thing had been done. McMasters used the horse to
drag out the take of the rope. He saw Del Williams
come to his knees on the wet sand, crawling, the limp
form of the girl still supported by his arm as he
staggered up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw her stand alone, her arms feeling out, dazed,
central figure now on a stage which was a wide sea of
whirling water. Whether or not she knew him he could
not tell. Taisie herself could feel little of definite plan.
But what McMasters saw, result of her impulse to
reach the one point of safety she could sense, was her
stumbling, hurrying, arms spread, to the saddle skirts
of Jim Nabours, who was on the narrow strip of sand
exposed by the lowered waters, hardened by the trampling
it had had.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl, scarce able to stand, flung an arm across
the old foreman’s saddle front. Upon the other side
Del Williams, following, suddenly reached out and
caught her hand, even as Jim laid hand upon her arm
to steady her. Her eyes, until now closed in terror,
opened and looked straight into those of Del Williams,
the man who from his own boyhood days had loved
her, as she knew; who had risked his life for her now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon you saved my life,” said she weakly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not specify. The man who had done the
essential thing was fifty feet away. But Dalhart heard
the words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the tense silence of the drama’s action was
resolved into hurly-burly, horses plunging, splashing,
snorting, men coiling ropes, all voluble in speech, undifferentiated
calls, shouting, accusations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come here, you!” Nabours called, beckoning to the
tall rider, apart, who was coiling his wet reata, looping
securely his pistol belt, pulling a latigo around his wet
coat to hold it better. But McMasters flung a hand in
salutation, deprecation, for what not, or for it all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But come on, man!” the foreman again commanded,
with what intent was not plain. The laughing
voice of McMasters came, clear and seemingly not
much perturbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See you at Abilene!” he called. Almost the next
instant he had spurred bodily into the flood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They watched him steadily carried out and down
and across by the set of the current, following the same
system Nabours had first used in crossing back to the
south bank. None of them knew that McMasters had
from his own chosen spot watched the whole crazy
operation of crossing the Red in freshet, had crossed
at a better ford below, and had within the hour taken
position near the camp on the far shore, whence he had
seen the last departure from the south bank—and done
some thinking and reasoning of his own about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll make it all right, damn him!” said Nabours,
in mixed emotions, as he watched the strange sight of
a man’s body, half out of water, plowing across, following
a small object dark and flat ahead, surmounting
a dark broken line, a V of ripples, even so, visible in the
tawny descending flood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not explain. No one explained. No one
made comment. Perhaps a sort of chagrin now held
them more or less, a feeling that glory lacked, that life
itself had lacked here, but for the casual, unrequited
aid of a man who had come and gone after doing the
essential thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Help her up, Del,” said Nabours. “Can you ride,
child?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taisie nodded, got into saddle when her horse was
brought across the wet bar. So she was not yet to die?
The thought was curious to her, bringing not elation
but surprise. She had not once spoken, had never once
cried out, appealed—not so much courage as resignment
to the wish of fate. And now fate had selected
a certain agency to give her back to life and its lackings.
She had neither joy nor sorrow in such thoughts
as came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours, his hand on Blancocito’s cheek strap, rode
with face held down, his mouth grim. He sighed so
deep it was well-nigh a groan, knowing that under his
leadership two human lives had been lost, a third almost
lost. Had that last consequence of his own folly ensued,
what then? It had come so close he now had no
perspective other than that it would have been the end
of the world. And the draggled figure at his side, passive
center of all the action, as woman is in all the great
crises of the world, had no better perspective. The
edge of the world lay at the south bank of the Red.
Well, he had reached that horizon, passed once more
beyond the edge of her world—that strange man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other two men dropped to the rear as Nabours
led Taisie’s horse out at the landing place. Del Williams
had ridden silent. Dalhart began to abuse him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’ll do! The whole thing was your fault,” said
Williams after a time. “You let your rope foul in that
log. It’s a wonder you didn’t drownd her. If you
say it was any part my fault, you’re a damned liar, and
you know it! Even thataway she’d have drownded,
and me, too, if it wasn’t for him.” He jerked his head
toward the opposite shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Neither man was armed, both were nearly naked.
They wheeled their horses head to head and sat looking
each into the other’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The world ain’t big enough for both us two,” said
Dalhart slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It shore ain’t,” answered the other man in even
tones. “What you say suits me. We’ve all promised
Jim there wouldn’t none of us make no break until we
had delivered the cows. Does that suit you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, till Abilene!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Till Abilene!”</p>

originally was crossed by the old Arbuckle
Trail, early known as the Whisky Trail, Rudabaugh
and his men lay encamped. They were and for
some days had been impatiently a-waiting news from
the south. Mr. Jameson, cattle inspector for the northern
district of Texas, brought them news; but Mr.
Jameson, for reasons of his own, preferred to preserve
his dignity; so his news was highly censored, expurgated.
He declared that his horse had thrown him into
a cactus patch. Moreover, he declared that the Del Sol
herd was already across the river and bound north;
whereas the truth was that he only had guessed that the
herd soon would cross, provided that the waters fell.
He had not tarried. Rudabaugh was irritated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ought to have got two bits a head straight
through for those cows,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re out of our jurisdiction now,” defended the
thornful fugitive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They ain’t never out of my jurisdiction!” rejoined
the leader savagely. “I’ll follow that outfit till hell
freezes. Where there ain’t no law is where Sim
Rudabaugh’s jurisdiction runs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I knew where that fellow McMasters is,” he
added. “I’m only waiting for him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That evening at dusk McMasters did come into camp.
Rudabaugh welcomed him with as much graciousness
as he could muster, but did not spare complaints over
the long delay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None of you Texans seem to know the value of
time,” he began. “You can’t look ahead. The herd
that breaks trail for five million Texas cows ruins every
plan for us if it gets to the railroad. If that herd gets
through, cows will be worth ten dollars a head in Texas
this fall, next year twenty dollars—and they have been
costing me twenty-five cents! When cows go to twenty
a head, land goes up with them. Now, it don’t take any
watchmaking to figure why I don’t want those things to
happen just yet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“McMasters, that herd must never get out of the
Nations. We’ve got to have this season to finish our
plans. I don’t intend to have my hand forced by any
red-head girl and her red-neck cow hands, I can tell
you that. Let that bunch trail north this summer, and
they’ll make a market for every cow in Texas! If they
don’t get north Sim Rudabaugh’ll be the richest man
that ever set foot on Texas soil. And what do you
suppose Texas will do for a man who can prove that
he has doubled and trebled and quadrupled the price of
every acre and every cow inside the lines of Texas?
In that case, Mr. Rudabaugh might be able to look
wider than the lines of Texas, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your plans do seem large,” said McMasters quietly.
“How can I help you in them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Every way in the world. Scout out on ahead. It’s
hard for me to keep my fingers on you, you shift about
so much; but if you help me break up the T. L. herd
there’ll be everything in it for you that you will ever
want in life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, you know I kept awful quiet. It’s a long
way out to the edge of the Staked Plains, and only a
few cowmen are in there now. But the lands I have
got my eye on are covered with vine mesquite like a
carpet, or with bunch grass almost as good. That’s
the coming cattle range, once the Comanches are off
of it. That’s where I am locating our lands. I want a
million acres more of scrip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And to think,” he added, “what all of that hangs
on! Leave them alone and they may find Abilene, for
all I know. I am taking no chances about that—that’s
why I want you. I want you to go on north and find
that outfit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll cross the river in the morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again he resumed his pacing and his cursing, in one
of the moods during which he really was out of his own
mind. He was well in his cups almost all the time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McMasters turned toward him suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You carry fire a long time, don’t you?” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never had any one oppose me yet that didn’t get
the worst of it,” replied the outlaw, ever serene in his
conceit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McMasters smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not even Burleson Lockhart?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not even Burleson Lockhart,” rejoined Rudabaugh
savagely. “He did!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pulled up. Something chill seemed to sit in the
air about him. “Well, come into camp,” said he, “and
let’s have a snort of liquor. I have got some left.”</p>

probably would be covered by the Del Sol herd. The
two courses naturally would converge somewhere to the
north and west, at some point on the Washita. He
pointed out that in no case could they miss the Del Sol
men, because certainly they would see the northbound
trail if they came to it, and could wait if they did not.
The logic of this appealed sufficiently to Rudabaugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the end of their first day’s march they stopped at
the edge of a walnut grove through which ran a little
stream. All that country was full of game, and Rudabaugh
took up his rifle, promising soon to come back
with meat for the company. McMasters himself, unobserved,
followed not far behind him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rudabaugh had been gone perhaps a quarter of an
hour or so when his mates heard two reports of his
rifle in the direction of the stream. He came in not
long after, but without any game.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Dave,” said one of his men, “did you get
your meat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I certainly did,” answered the ruffian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You didn’t bring it in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It ain’t that kind of meat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stood looking at him. His smile was distorted.
He began to work himself into one of his rages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you heard my promise!” he broke out.
“Down yonder I told you that I intended to kill the first
Indian I saw in the Nations. I don’t bluff and I don’t
miss—there’s two Indians laying in there. If you
don’t believe it go and look. I told you I’d show those
people how to steal my horses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A man or two slipped out of the camp, moved over
toward the edge of the little stream. Hard men they
were, and used to rough deeds; but what they saw
made them start back shuddering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two Indian women, one young, lay upon the farther
bank. Their clothing remained upon the nearer shore.
They had been bathing, and hearing the approach of an
intruder had started up the farther bank. There they
had been overtaken by the aim of the most heartless
ruffian that ever crossed even that dark and bloody
land. The older woman now lay dead, the younger
even yet was struggling to reach the cover of the
thicket. Hearing the sound of yet others coming, she
fell forward on her face.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They both were women,
and had the younger woman lived——</p>

<p class='pindent'>McMasters, following close behind Rudabaugh, was
not close enough to see him when he fired, but soon he
saw what had been done. Horrified, he turned away,
leaving the men he met to see for themselves. He
picked up the moccasins the women had left on the
hither bank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His step was light as that of a panther when he
entered the camp. He crossed the grass to where
Rudabaugh now sat, and touched him lightly on the
shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get up, you damned hound!” he said. “Get up
and look a man in the face, you beastly, murdering
coward!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rudabaugh reached for his weapon before he struggled
upright, but stayed his hand in time. The two
hands of the younger man were raised above the dark
revolver stocks. But he did not fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The man who would do a thing like that is no part
of a man at all!” Rudabaugh and all his remaining
men heard the words. “I’ll not ride a foot with a murderer
like you. Now take my advice—get out of here
fast as you can! If these people catch up with you
they’ll even things with you—their village can’t be far
from here. Those women never harmed you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You all heard my word!” Rudabaugh’s voice broke
hoarsely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve heard mine! I ought to kill you now, but
I am going to leave you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The lousy thieves!” Rudabaugh tried to work up
his vanished rage. “You think I’ll let them steal my
horses and get away with it? It’s two less of them.
Besides, there’s no law in here. Besides, you’re going
to break your own word.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eye of McMasters narrowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t say that again,” said he. “I am saving you
for a later day. Those were Comanches that you
killed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re not Comanches!” asserted Rudabaugh.
“The Comanches don’t range in here. It’s all Chickasaws
above here. They were Chickasaws, or maybe
Wacos.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dan McMasters held up two moccasins before he
replaced them in his pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know Comanche moccasins when I see them,”
said he. “Those women left these when they went
into the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no use your trying to trail me,” he added,
as he backed to the edge of the wood where his horse
was tethered. “I tell you, the best thing you can do is
to get out of here as fast as you can!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was not a man in all that armed band that had
courage to reach hand to weapon as he passed. Perhaps
a sullen contempt for their leader had come to
them. Rudabaugh’s own blasphemies, his sudden recovery
of his weapons came too late. McMasters was
in saddle and riding, hid by the cover of the wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first they thought he had headed for the north,
as they later trailed his horse. But half a mile farther
on they saw where he had turned in his tracks and
headed directly south.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know where he went,” remarked one trailer,
“but I wish I did. He’s likely to be mad enough to set
the Rangers after us again. I more’n half believe right
now that he had a hand in their catching us down at
Del Sol. If we’d got away with all that scrip Rudabaugh
says there was we’d have been out of this,
maybe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Rangers can’t work anywhere outside the state
of Texas,” his associate reminded him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, that’s so; they can’t. But the Comanches
can!”</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>I</span></span>T was high noon of the third day north of the Red
River; a frank spring noon on the prairies. All
the morning nothing except the countless wild
game had offered life and motion to the eye of Jim
Nabours, scouting carefully ahead of the herd. But
now, as he topped a gentle rise, he saw coming toward
him from the cover of a clump of distant timber the
figure of a rider whom soon he knew to be a white
man. He pulled up, sat intent. The rider seemed a not
unfamiliar figure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The horseman advanced directly toward him, evidently
seeing him. As he approached more closely in
his steady trot he flung up his right hand in the sign
of peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours himself rode out to meet the stranger. All
at once he halted sharply, his hand on his gun. But the
other paid no attention to the hostile movement, came
up at the same pace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How are you, Jim Nabours?” said he quietly. He
dropped both his hands to his own saddle horn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A scowl came over the foreman’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have broke your word, Mr. McMasters,” said
he. “You are in a risky place right now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I come with my hands up,” said McMasters. “I’m
in no more risk than you are. But I am going back
with you to your own camp.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! We want no truck with you.” Then a sense
of the proprieties coming to him, he added, “You’re
counting too damn much on what you done down at
the Red. No one ast you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look at my horse,” said McMasters quietly. “He’s
a Fishhook, isn’t he? Yes. And I have been back of
this herd or alongside of it for three hundred and fifty
miles. You know that you got my letter, and you seem
to have followed my advice. You’ve done very well
by it. You’d have done a lot better if I’d been with you
before you tried that crossing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we put you out of our camp oncet. We
meant it. We hain’t held no trial sence then. I haven’t
ast you in, no time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; but you don’t seem to be able to keep me out.
I’ll ride this country the way I like, and not even Texans
can keep me from it. I have come now because I think
you need me again, and need me very much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He told his news. The features of Nabours changed
as he listened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My God!” said he. Then, suspicion dominant
again: “But you was traveling with them people. You
went right from us to them. Now here you’re back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I need travel with them no more. I have got what
I was after. I know who killed my father and Miss
Lockhart’s father. I am coming into your camp, and
I am going to talk with Miss Lockhart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She sont you out oncet. We tried you. She won’t
talk to you—no, not even after what you done. She’s
never mentioned your name about that.” Nabours still
sat looking at him uneasily. “Besides, my men won’t
let you in again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No? I have been in your camp more than once
since you first put me out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not that I know of, you haven’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No? Jim, who killed that man near the women’s
carts the night of the big run on the Colorado?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know who killed him; I only know he was
dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that man was after the trunk you thought
that I had stolen. Rudabaugh wants that trunk. He
sent his boldest man after it that night. I was a little
ahead of him, that was all. You know what happened
to him. Now you know who did it. Yes, you might
say I stole Miss Lockhart’s trunk and put it in my
wagon. But I stole it from Rudabaugh, not from her.
What I said at the trial was true. Theft from her—why,
good Heavens!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He suddenly spread out his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m a killer now, Jim!” said he, his face strangely
drawn by a smile that could not come to it. “I can’t
turn back now. The man who says I ever was a friend
of Rudabaugh is a liar, and a fool besides. I call that
to you here. I will call it to your whole campful just
the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Them’s right strong words,” said Jim Nabours
quietly. “I only listen because I more’n half believe
you’re right. I can’t answer what you say. But why
in hell didn’t you say all this at the trial?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Trial! Who gave you any right to try a McMasters
of Gonzales? I took what you-all gave me because I
thought it might make it easier for me to stay away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I don’t know what you mean by that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; and I don’t know that I can make you understand.
Let me say, I realized that my path and hers
could never run together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you’re in the Indian Nations now. There are
three hundred Comanches in here somewhere north of
you that have come in from the Plains to visit with the
Kiowas. That’s Yellow Hand’s band. If you meet
those Comanches after what they surely will hear—why,
I suppose, you might maybe be willing to have a
good killer along with you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I supposed maybe you’d be thankful to get this
word in time. So, to that extent, you see, my path
does once more run for a little way not far from hers.
Maybe she’ll talk to me. I’m going to see. You can’t
any of you stop me. You’ve all been ignorant fools.
You deserve nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I used to read my Bible, in Sunday school,” said
Nabours after a long silence. “I done read about that
there, now, Rachel—was it?—same name, she had, as
Cohen’s wife down to Gonzales, of the Golden Eagle
Store. Now Jacob, he was a good cow hand, and he
worked seven years night wrangling for said Rachel—maybe
her name was Rebecca, I don’t know. Well,
anyhow, I reckon, maybe it was all right about Jacob
and the ranch boss. The trouble with me is, I got too
damned many Jacobs along already in this here outfit.
I wasn’t studying to take on no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still, when the men hear about old Yellow Hand it’s
more’n likely they’ll be glad to pick up a hand that can
throw lead if he has to. Come on in. I won’t let
nobody start nothing. We can dig into this further
along.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>McMasters paid no attention to the other men about
the camp that evening, who, even after the foreman’s
explanation, remained sullen and aloof. Without asking
consent, he walked to the cook-cart plunder, unearthed
his own bed roll and war bag and chose a place
for himself outside the circle appropriated by the other
hands. He made such toilet as he could, helped himself
at the cook’s kettle and pans—breaking a two days’
fast—all without converse with the men who once had
adjudged him unfit for their association. And in the
twilight he walked without any by-your-leave directly
to the camp of Taisie Lockhart and her servants. They
watched him go. She saw him coming in the dusk;
she felt her heart leap strangely. How could she keep
her face calm, her eyes severe?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is Mr. McMasters?” she spoke coldly, did not
put out her hand. He had remained silent, his own
face sad enough. “Why do you come—how dare you
come?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had not asked him to be seated; was treating
him as though he were one of the hands; as though he
were her enemy, not her hereditary friend or ally, not
a man who had saved her life but now. It was hard
even for his courage to endure. Something at last gave
way. When he spoke a resonance was in his voice
which she had never known before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dare? Why did I dare come? I dared not stay
away!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You always presume on obligations I never asked
of you. But I can’t see—I don’t know——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know I love you; that’s the thing I can’t help.
You couldn’t help knowing it. I am the man who
kissed you that night in the dark—yes, I did that. You
knew! I won’t tell you why I was there that night, or
why I am here now. Forget what happened the other
day at the river—you’d as well. The woman who
doubts me once is done with me forever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She could not speak to this new man, savage, impetuous,
the chill all gone from him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dare? I do dare! I dare tell you that there will
never be any other woman in the world for me. I’ll
never be even the last man in the world for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Doubt, contrition, fear—a horrible fear that she had
been cruelly unjust, a yet more terrible fear that he was
going away—all mingled in the mind of the girl who
heard him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot possibly understand how you could come.
I don’t know why you should. Always you put a load
on me.” Her own voice had been more certain at other
times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His answer came very slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A man has an indefeasible right to tell the one
woman in the world that he cares for her, even if he
is going to the gallows. I might as well be on my way
to the gallows, so far as any chance with you is concerned.
Chance? Why, a chance with you? I’d not
give myself one if I could. Look at my hands!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He extended his hands, long, slender, well kept, so
that she might see.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am a killer!” said Dan McMasters bitterly.
“That’s what I have become for sake of Texas, for
sake of the law, for sake of women and children, I suppose.
But no woman or child for me! It’s worse to be
a killer than it is to be killed. Well I know that. But I
was mad that night. I just thought of what might have
happened to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir, this is not easy to listen to!” She sank back
on her rude fireside seat, trembling. “I wish you had
not come! I wish I had never seen you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can say the same! But why do you wish that?
It’s easy to forget me. But I cannot forget.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stepped closer, his voice low. She only shook her
head from side to side and would not speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” he demanded again fiercely; and still she
answered not at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have nothing to forget,” he went on. “It may
be easy for women to forget—I don’t know. But it is
my curse that I can never change—I can’t forget. What
I want I must have—I can’t change!” He sighed. His
hands dropped, still crooked to clasp her, to grasp her
arms, and hold her fast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, say that I come to you now only as a peace
officer to-night. I have used my own methods. That’s
all the life work there is for Daniel McMasters. There
is no possible reward for me except to come to you
some time and tell you that I have finished the work
I started out to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat, her head bowed forward in her hands. A
cricket was calling loudly in the grass. Presently she
heard the man’s even voice go on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know who killed your father and mine. I could
have killed Rudabaugh three days ago. I ought to have
done so. I was on the point of killing him. What
kept me from it? I knew that some one of his men
would kill me if I did, but that ought not to have mattered—I
don’t think it would have mattered; we have
to take those chances in my business. Why did I hold
back? Why did I wait for another time? I’ll have to
tell you! Suddenly I thought, ‘If these men kill me
now I’ll never see her face again!’ Wasn’t it silly?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon I wanted to see your face again. I’d not be
honest if I did not tell you that. I, McMasters of the
Rangers, held back—for that! But this will be the last
time. I came to your camp—it was a hard thing for a
proud man to do. Well, now you know why I dared.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t you be seated, sir?” Taisie’s voice came
faintly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; you speak too late. I must go. But before I go
I shall tell you once more, so you may remember it
always—I love you more than anything else and everything
else in all the world. There’ll never be any other
woman for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, why, why?” she demanded hoarsely. “What
is it that you mean when you say that you must go—that
you never will——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cricket in the grass was asserting himself loudly,
insistently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Life is short for me,” he answered. “It may be
long for you. Why should I pretend, who am about
to die?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice was relentless. He carried always the feeling
of relentlessness, of an unemotional, unconditional
coldness in purpose. An icy man, a terrible man,
even now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again the cricket, for a little space. The firelight
was but faint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly he sank on his knees beside her, one hand
on the bed roll that made her seat, so that he could look
into her face. But her hands covered it. He touched
her hand. It was wet with tears. Slowly he drew
back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have I said? What have I done?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, you should be content!” she broke out presently.
“You have your revenge!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean? I can’t well stand to hear you
say that. Revenge?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes! Very well, I called you a thief once. Let that
go. You are one now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was entirely silent for a long space, trying to
understand. Then she felt her fingers caught in a clasp
like steel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have I stolen anything I ought not to have taken?
Tell me! Believe me, that one thing I never dreamed!
I never thought that you—that you did—that you ever
could! You don’t! You cannot! That can never be!
That’s not possible! There are many men in the world
for you—all of them—for you. I said only that there
was no other woman but you in all the world for me.
I didn’t ask or expect even justice, even mercy, from
you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are avenged!” said Anastasie Lockhart again.
“It is noble of you! You—you reason well! You
come in the night!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After all, how could they avoid youth, evade love?
In some way, when or how, neither of them knew, they
were standing. He had caught her up, they were face
to face, body to body. Their arms found themselves
about each other. He felt her arms about his neck, his
shoulders; to her his clasp was like steel. He saw
her face, pale, wet, wholly adorable, irresistible, a
woman of a million. She saw his eyes, studious, marveling,
frowning, his face one she never had seen
before. It was done. It was too late.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He struggled as though to put off a mask, as though
some armor coat oppressed him. Their lips met as
though they dreamed; they did not know of plan at
all, were as two dazed, beyond volition, beyond right
or wrong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was he who drew back, half sobbing, still wrestling
with that something, now that it was too late. He felt
the swift rush of her awakened impetuous woman
emotion, strong and sudden as though some dam had
been disrupted to let an unmeasured torrent through;
felt her arms slide back along the sides of his neck, her
hands catch the sides of his face as they parted. Her
face was not that of a country girl kissed merrily by
some swain, or evilly; it was high, serious, not illusioned,
calm; the face of a great soul in a splendid
beauty, a woman of a million; a face terrible and
young, as was his own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were no tears now. The great hour, the one
instant for two strong natures had arrived—had passed.
If any theft were done it had been done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were a savage, a criminal!” said she after a
time, voicing that. “But what is done is done, and
what is written is written. Many men? Where?
And I think I shall hate you now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She heard his voice as of a man musing, chanting to
himself: “I was strong! You are taking my strength
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you want me to break my vow to my state?”
He groaned after a time. “Would you ruin a man?
Do you want me killed before my day’s over? I love
you, and it cannot be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose not.” Her voice dreamed. “I said, you
are avenged. But I suppose I was wrong about—about
calling you a thief. That trial—I suppose I ought to
tell you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s too late! I told you, I can never change.
That’s my curse—I can’t change. My honor is as good
as you are good, and I know you are. But you doubted
me once. It was forever. I don’t know how to forgive
that, for man or woman. And even if you hadn’t, I’m
not for you. Unclean! Unclean! Look at my hands—they’re
red, I say. Look at yours—white, sweet,
good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He choked, struggled; could no more than crush her
hands to his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not for us!” he said at last. “Yes, I’m a thief.
I’m almost a coward. I did not know. I’ll never ask
you to forgive me. Let me go. Let me finish my
work. If I live, when I’m old and done and crippled,
let me come and kiss the hem of your garment. There
are—there must be—other men. They say there’s more
than one love, for a woman. I don’t know. I reckon
that’s not true. Oh, if I could only change!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But even so he could not go. Frowning, he caught
her face in his steel-like hands once more, and at the
flame ripple of her hair above her temple kissed her
again and again and yet again where he had seen
her cup her hand over the first kiss he gave her—stolen
also—in the dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was gone. What comfort for her now? Or what
for him? There is no such thing as fairness in love
between man and woman.</p>

wild paradise through which these pioneers of
a new industry were passing. Civilized, semi-civilized,
even savage mankind lacked then in the
Nations. The country was unsettled and unknown.
The men of Del Sol neither followed nor intersected
any trail of hoof or wheel. Only the deep paths of the
buffalo, immemorial, marked the green carpet of unbroken
sod. There never had been hoof of any domestic
creature here. The bands of horses that swept
away were wild horses. Wild deer, wild antelope made
their only neighbors. There was not a weed. There
was not a bee. The white man had not come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of them all, not one Del Sol man had any idea of
the country ahead. They were only holding to the
easiest way, the ridges that separated the heads of
divergent streams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours held his silence as long as he could, but at
length spurred up to the morose and solitary man who
rode without a word regarding the herd, himself or his
own plans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. McMasters,” said he, “I don’t know where we
are right now. I don’t know where we’re going. We
haven’t got no map. I don’t know when Rudabaugh
may jump us. It’s time you and me got plumb
serious.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I think so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For instance, we ain’t on no Chisholm Trail?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, that’s over in east, if it can be called a trail.
Fort Sill—that’s what they call the camp where the
soldiers stop, in west toward the Wichita Mountains—is
the nearest white settlement. It’s only a camp;
there is no actual Army post there yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My notion, soldiers mostly ride around and don’t
do nothing much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’d do more if they were let alone by the Indian
Department. Those men are doing what Captain
Marcy advised fifteen years ago—figuring on an Army
post north of the Red, to watch the Comanches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The worst Comanches, as you know, are the
Quahrada bands—that’s old Yellow Hand. Their
right range is north of the Buffalo Gap and west into
the Staked Plains; that’s their big buffalo country.
But I think word has gone out for some kind of a
council between them and the Kiowas, and that’s what
has brought Yellow Hand in here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The policy of the Indian Department now, as you
may know,” he went on explaining, “is to round up
all these Indian tribes and get them on reservations.
That’s going to mean war, next year probably. This
whole country in here is just as like as not to be on
foot right now. The best hope we’ve got is that none
of them get together with Rudabaugh.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s fine, ain’t it? And you done told me that
Rudabaugh was heading in ahead to meet us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He doesn’t know where we are any more than we
know where he is. If we keep on north and he keeps
on up the Washita we’d naturally intersect at the crossing
of the Washita, two or three days’ drive north of
here. I don’t know which will get there first. He
travels light.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What d’you think I’d ought to do?” demanded
Nabours, after a time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is not much you can do. When you go into
camp every night set your wagon tongue so that it
points toward the North Star. Line out on that course
the next morning. Keep on going north for a month.
What comes, comes. But keep your herd closed up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I done sont my cook cart on ahead a ways,”
admitted Nabours. “I told Sam to kill a buffalo and
pick out a good camping place, if it looked anything
like a bed ground.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What comes, comes,” said McMasters once more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They separated, since he would talk no more. He
rode apart from the herd, would accept no duties, no
friendships, never cast a glance toward the closed cart
where Taisie had taken refuge.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours hardly had resumed his place at the head
of the column before he found cause enough for actual
alarm. On ahead there was coming toward him the
white top of the cook cart, its oxen lashed to a gallop
by the negro driver. Buck made no attempt to stop his
vehicle, but thundered by with the evident intention of
getting as far to the rear as possible. The shrieks
of Milly, who had gone on in the cart, rose continuously.
Nabours was obliged to ride ahead to bring
the cart to a halt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What in hell do you mean by this?” demanded he
of the frightened negro.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fo’ Gawd, Massa Jim, don’t go up dah! Dey’s
five thousand Injuns right up dah! Dey’s a million
buffaloes not two mile ahead, beyant the woods, and
them Injuns is a cuttin’ and a chargin’!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on down to the other cart and pull up close!”
commanded the trail boss. “Hurry, now!” He spurred
off to the point of the herd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Throw ’em off the trail, men!” he called out.
“Make the herd right here! Injuns! Get your rifles
out!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In ten minutes the strip of prairie was covered a half
mile deep with a mass of cattle, and the remuda was
closed up at the rear. The men made a rude laager of
the bed rolls in front of the carts and ordered the
women to keep hid. So far as might be, they were
ready for what must come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It came soon. The cattle shuffled as they stood,
turned, raised their heads. A thunder of countless
hoofs grew loud, louder. And now became visible,
close at hand, one of the wild spectacles of the tribesmen’s
country. A vast black mass of running buffalo
appeared, strung out in little clumps as far as the eye
could reach. Heads down, their beards sweeping the
grass tops, they ran, an endless series of black, rolling
forms, in a tremendous momentum that shook the very
sod—the wildest picture of a wild world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men who immemorially owned that world were
here. Naked horsemen clung on the flank of the herd.
It was the Comanches, at the savage trade which the
Comanches most loved and best practiced—that of
lancing the wild buffalo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A half hundred, perhaps a hundred riders, stretched
out in a long line—in fact a line two miles or more in
length. The savages, stripped to the waist, rode their
bareback horses alongside and into the detached masses
of black which stretched west and north out as far as
the horizon. Even in the distance and in the dust they
might have been known to be Comanches, since they
thus were at work with the lance. That was always the
favorite Comanche weapon in the buffalo hunt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing imaginable could be more cruel or more
efficient than their trade as these wild riders now were
practicing it. Each spearman rode even with his
chosen quarry. It was not his purpose to strike it in
the vitals, but only to disable it. A hunter leaned sideways
suddenly, plunging, both his arms raised. A
lunge, a heave backward to wrench the point clear, and
the great beast fell, cut through the loins; not killed
at once, but sure to fall; which was enough for the
savage workman. The old men or squaws following
after with their bows and arrows would finish what the
long lances had begun. To the rear a mile-long line of
black struggling blots lay on the grass. But the blood
lust of the riders had not yet been glutted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their chase was now to end. Their attention, rapt
as they had been in the pursuit they loved above all
others, could not now escape the sudden sound which
broke upon their ears even over the hoof roar of the
buffalo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a vast rush of crackling hoofs and rattling horns
the entire Del Sol herd was now off in the wildest
stampede any of the men had ever seen. Worst of all,
they were not undertaking to evade but to join the
stampede of the buffalo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Always there was a sort of affiliation between the
wild and the domestic cattle of the Plains; and all old
plainsmen knew how difficult it was to separate the two,
once they were commingled. This commingling of wild
and half wild, with the attendant rumbling and trembling
under the hoofs of all these thousands of running
creatures, made a swift climax to the scene. The black
mass, lengthened and strung out by the impact of the
line of hunters, now was joined by a vast influx of
lighter colored animals, coming in at an angle. Red
men might take toll of this. White men could not
control it. No men could stop it now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The savages had ridden long. There was an endless
line of black blots rising and falling on the prairies
back of them. The stampede of the Del Sol herd was
sufficient to break the trance of slaughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Spears in hand, naked, their arms red to the
shoulders, their bodies red to the waist, a group of
the riders broke away from their chase and came up,
grinning and shouting, to where they saw the white
men huddled. They had taken their time. The
Comanches entertained but little fear of the whites.
They were insolent lords of the far Southwest, raiding
the feeble Mexicans as they liked and even imperiously
telling the Anglo-Saxon frontiersman when he must
cease advancing or even pull back his frontier lines.
They always had held the best of the cattle range as
well as the best of the buffalo range of Texas, and had
kept the cowman out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These had no fear now of the whites. They carried
with them proof of that. Repeating their own tribal
history of grim sense of humor, at some sutler’s store
looted far to the west they had practiced one of the jests
they had been known to employ in early border times.
They had gathered bolts of flannel, bales of gaudy
calico, from which they had liberally taken decorations
for their horses. Not one of the latter that did not
have attached to his mane and tail such strips of calico
as long and rough riding had left him. It was the
pleasant Comanche practice to tie one end of a bolt of
cloth or calico to the tail of a horse and then to ride off,
leaving the fabric to unwind as it listed and the horse
to run as it chose. These wild decorations, unknown of
origin, still clung in colored fragments to the blood-stained
ponies which they rode. The ends of the prints
fluttered in the prairie wind, mocking the flowers in
their own remaining hues.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No herd of cattle could have withstood the sight of
this wild phantasmagoria. The men who owned these
felt that their own time had come. Without command,
each man dropped low behind his bed roll, his
rifle resting above his bent arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t let than in, men—but don’t shoot yet!
They’ve got nothing but spears!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the voice of Dan McMasters which arose.
He alone of them all was standing, rifle in hand. He
threw up his hand in the command to halt as the Red
men came on in, slapping his rifle stock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Comanches paid little attention to any command,
but made no immediate motion of hostility.
Their leader was a great-chested man with wide chin
and mouth and narrow eyes. Jabbering in his own
tongue, two-thirds Spanish, he grinned as he came on
close up to the rifles which covered him and his men.
At length he threw up his own hand carelessly, indifferently,
curiously, as though he now would see what
was to be found hereabouts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How, <span class='it'>amigo</span>! How, <span class='it'>amigo</span>!” called out McMasters.
No one had chosen him as leader, but none now
denied him the place. “<span class='it'>Usted</span> Yellow Hand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The leader rode out carelessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Si</span>,” said he. “Me Yellow Han’. <span class='it'>Habla Español?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Si</span>,” replied McMasters, and went on in that tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a few moments of rapid talk he turned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He says they are Quahradas, but are riding through,
going home. Says he wants some spotted buffaloes.
Says they are on Indian land and we have got to get
out. Says we will have to give him half our horses
and all our tobacco. Says he knows we have got something
in the wagons because we keep the covers tight.
Says we can’t go on through, but have got to go back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You tell him to go to hell!” broke out Jim Nabours.
“Tell him I know who he is. Yellow Hand has got no
right in here. Tell him the soldiers will be after him
for chasing the Chickasaws’ buffalo. Flour—beef—tobacco?
Tell him we won’t give him a damned thing!
Tell him if he rides ten feet further in we’ll open fire
and clean ’em out—our rifles shoot a week and we
don’t have to load.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He patted the stock of the rifle which he held up
before him in defiance—one of the Henry repeating
rifles, first of repeating arms seen in the Southwest
after the Civil War; and already the Comanches knew
what these repeating rifles meant. Old Yellow Hand
also knew that his men had nothing but their spears. He
traded Comanche lives as dear as possible always.
No doubt it occurred to him that he could get all the
beef he wanted by following the stampede. Perhaps
he figured that night time would be a better hour for an
attack—when all his warriors were on hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heap shoot!” called out Jim Nabours, again slapping
the side of his rifle. Yellow Hand grinned
pleasantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How! How! Heap <span class='it'>amigo</span>,” said he. He advanced
a foot or so, his hand outstretched. “What
you got in <span class='it'>carreta</span>? <span class='it'>Que tienez?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He motioned toward the closed fronts of the cart
covers, pointing with his spear. McMasters’ rifle
barrel struck up the spear shaft. Yellow Hand could
see the hammers of the rifles lying down like the heads
of so many rattlesnakes. He could see the light shining
on the brass plates of these Henry rifles. Comanches on
the Concho had told him that a rifle which had this
yellow spot on it would keep on shooting forever without
any need for loading again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Si, seguro!</span>” he now said calmly. “Heap shoot!”
He waved a hand towards the rifles. “<span class='it'>Muy grande
escopetas.</span> Heap swap. <span class='it'>Uno caballo por uno escopeta</span>!”
He meant he would trade a horse for a repeating
rifle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Nada</span>, damn your soul!” broke out Jim Nabours:
“You vamose pretty damn <span class='it'>pronto</span>! I’m sorry I ever
learned your damned language, but you hear me now.
<span class='it'>A doondey usted</span>—where’d you come from here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Nos vamenos, si.</span>” said Yellow Hand ingratiatingly.
“<span class='it'>Poco tiempo.</span> Swap?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve got a gall,” rejoined Nabours, whose blood
now was up as he began to think of what had happened
to his herd. “Git on out or I’ll kill you for luck!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chieftain turned towards McMasters, whom he
again addressed in Spanish. McMasters replied quietly,
evenly, evidently arguing and pointing out certain facts
which ought to be observed; which facts had to do with
spears as against repeating rifles; with buffalo as
against beef.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a time Yellow Hand turned back to his followers,
who had sat their horses impatiently. He spoke
a few words in explanation. Then, without paying any
more attention whatever to the whites, they all turned
and rode away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the time safe, the white men arose and looked
at one another, still almost too much strained for
speech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look yonder!” said Nabours at length.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Off to the west and north other Indians were appearing,
group after group, evidently the followers who did
the butchering of the fallen buffalo. With spears and
bows and arrows they were finishing the work which
had been begun. Obviously there must be some considerable
village not far away, for many or most of
these advancing figures were those of squaws engaged
in the butchering work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are in no hurry,” said McMasters after a
time. “They are willing to wait. Bows and arrows.
They don’t seem to have any guns.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Del Sol men looked around them for the horses
which they had picketed, broke the front before the
carts, where now could be heard women’s lamentations.
The boy, Cinquo Centavos, was disclosed sitting with
his back against the cart front of his mistress, a Sharpe
rifle across his knees. Tears were running down his
cheeks—not tears of fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My horses is all gone!” said he, sobbing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hell, the cows is gone, too!” commented Dalhart.
“It’s lucky we ain’t!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McMasters, once banished, had now without election
been received back into the ranks of the Del Sol men.
Indeed, he was now their leader. Before the stripped
trail drovers made any move they held council.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yellow Hand knows he don’t have to swap,” said
McMasters. “He knows he can choose between dead
buffalo and dead cattle. Our horses—they know what
we’ve got in that line. They know all they want to
know, except what’s in there.” He nodded toward the
carts. “They’ll come back to find that out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men all looked at him in silence. He spoke
again, to Nabours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s only one good thing about this whole
thing,” he said. “Rudabaugh has not seen these men.
They haven’t heard of the killing of those two
Comanche women. If they had they’d have rushed us
long ago. The women must have been in a visiting
village, over toward the Arbuckle hills.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours was silent for a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The jig’s up. We’d just as well leave the herd,”
said he at length. “We can’t spare men to send after
them. It looks like our only hope is to push on ahead
with the carts and find a place to fight for what we’ve
got left.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McMasters nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think that’s best. They know they’ve got only
bows and arrows against our repeating rifles. Horses
they like more than anything else. Maybe they’ll be
contented with rounding up our remuda if we slip
away. Maybe we can come back again and pick up
what they leave us. At least, they don’t yet know what
we have in there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more he nodded toward the close-drawn flaps
of the carts, to which not a man had yet ventured.
They did not want the women to know. “We’d better
be on our way before anything worse happens.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours nodded. The broken cavalcade closed in
and soon was moving north once more, now convoying
nothing but the shrouded carts, around which they
formed a cordon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unencumbered with the herd, they made a dozen
miles in their hurried march, and finally chose a camping
place upon a little eminence crowned with a few
straggling trees, which gave them good sight of the
surrounding country. They made their camp with
the carts inside the circle of guards; hobbled and
picketed their remaining saddle horses and put up such
barricade as they could. They now had done the last
that remained within their power. Nabours told the
women to come to the men’s camp. A fire was built,
but was kept low.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taisie Lockhart joined her men, her face exceedingly
pale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the Comanches!” she broke out at last. “I have
brought you into this!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ma’am,” said Nabours at length, “that’s hardly a
fair way of speaking. It’s us has brought you. We
all throwed in together in this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told you I was broke and couldn’t pay you,”
sobbed the girl, “and you wouldn’t quit. Oh, if you
only had!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She missed one figure in the gathering of rough-clad
hard-bitten men. A trifle apart, McMasters paid no
attention either to her or any one else. Nabours caught
the direction of her glance and nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We done taken him on the herd, full, now,” said
he. “We need men that can shoot. Go on back to
sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Taisie Lockhart no more slept than did the others.
There was no shoulder against which she could lean.
The voice of the cricket was no more. In its stead
came the raucous roar of the gray wolves scenting
blood.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='239' id='Page_239'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXVII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE GAME OF THE GODS</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>O</span></span>NCE upon a time the immortal gods, desirous
of playing their favorite game, in which
mortals are used as pawns, cast down upon
the surface of the earth their great chessboard. It
was simple, having but four squares. They traced a
wandering and wavering line two thousand miles in
length along the indefinite line between the tall grass
of the prairies and the bunch grass of the plains. It
lay somewhere near what men afterwards came to call
the one-hundredth meridian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Across this line at right angles they put down yet
another indefinite line to finish off their board. Since
they knew nothing of geography or mathematics or
politics, they did not call this line the parallel of thirty-six
north. For them it was enough that it loosely
divided the land of winter snows from that of winter
suns. They cared not that at some time it might be
the indefinite line between corn and cotton, between
lean beef and fat, between breeding and feeding. They
knew nothing of quarantine. It was nothing to them
that had they gone one degree further north they
would have established the south line of a land called
by men the state of Kansas. They had never heard
of the state of Kansas; or of the Missouri Compromise;
or of slavery. They dealt with a great land
which then and now has been forever free. Men
came to call it the West.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The great east-and-west line, like the great north-and-south
line, one day was to be broken down and
forgotten, after the immortal gods had kept their
chessboard sufficiently long to themselves and had
wearied of their game. They left the chessboard to
their pawns and sat back, idly watching them, smiling
that the pawns knew so little of great games.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>When the early herds pushed up into that unknown
land from the straggling half-Spanish settlements of
the Southwest men ignorantly walked over wealth
which they then did not heed and did not need—the
wealth that lay under the tall grasses and the short
grasses. Of the bunch grass, the vine mesquite grass,
and the redtop and the Eastern bluestem, they could
talk understandingly. They lived in a day and land
as yet pastoral. But their cattle walked over unsuspected
millions of millions of gallons of oil that one
day later would be needed. The rude white bandits
of the nation, men even of Rudabaugh’s shrewd type,
themselves did not suspect the measureless measures of
coal and other minerals that lay under their feet. The
immortal gods smiled at them, knowing that in time
they would give their pawns everything they needed,
equal to their changed requirements, as age succeeded
age.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, pawns on the great chessboard of the gods
where not even pawns ever had been placed before,
the ragged crew of Del Sol was pushing up, two
degrees eastward of the north-and-south dividing line.
They had been traveling somewhere near the ninety-eighth
meridian, of which not one of them ever had
heard. Not many of them ever had heard of thirty-six-thirty,
or of the Missouri Compromise. They fought
a war without much history, for the rank and file, as
always is the case, had but narrow horizons. They
were simply cowmen; and now they were driving north.
To them Abilene, their objective, was as vague a thing
as had been the cities of Cibola to Coronado’s men
when they also once crossed the great chessboard of
the immortal gods, caring not even for the grasses, so
good for buffalo and cows, and also missing all the
minerals that lay beneath their feet, although it was
one mineral they sought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was in the past. The immortal gods had
decided that now it was time for men to move north.
There was to be a great new constructive day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it seems that there is implanted in Nature and
in the universe the law of two opposing forces; centrifugal
and centripetal; good and evil; constructive
and destructive; that which feeds and is preyed upon
by that which fattens; that which produces and creates,
countered by that which destroys and tears down; that
which sows to reap, and that which reaps where it has
not sown. Therefore it was quite as much foreordained
that Rudabaugh and his men should pass
north to prey on the Del Sol herd as that the Del Sol
herdsmen should be driving north into a new day.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Be all these things assigned such causes as they may
in each man’s philosophy, at the end of his nose or
farther, a new epoch was at hand for the vast unsettled
West. Rudabaugh and his men had discussed that
daily and nightly as they pushed on up the Washita
River of the Indian Nations. They finally camped
at the ford of the Washita, well in advance of the Del
Sol men and directly north of them, although neither
knew the proximity of the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ruffian leader had no more than twenty men
in his band. He had recruited these from classes
naturally unscrupulous and restless under any law. But
all criminal tendency is in its way a sort of individual
initiative, self-assertiveness, after all; so that Rudabaugh
found his men not always wholly submissive
to any man’s will. They were less so now than ever.
Repeatedly Rudabaugh had to explain to them again
and over again that they were after large game, that
the division would be large per capita. They were
more like Coronado’s men—wanted mineral in hand;
minted mineral.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I don’t mind saying,” remarked one of the
bolder of his men at the second night of encampment
at the Washita crossing—a city lies near there to-day—“I’ll
be free to say that I don’t noways like the look
of things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rudabaugh turned to him savagely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you? What’s the matter with you,
Baldy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There wasn’t no cause to kill them Indian women.
If we don’t keep moving, them Comanches may run
into us any time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’d we move?” sneered Rudabaugh. “What
are we after up here? Have I got to make a picture-block
map to show you? Don’t you see, you damned
numskull, if that herd gets to the railroad the whole
jig is up for us? We’ve got to make our clean-up
right now, this season or not at all, I keep telling you.
We’ve got to get our scrip and get our lands, and get
our surveyors out to locate them; and we’ve got to do
it all now. Next year will be too late if that herd
gets through. I’ve told you all this a dozen times.
Now if you don’t like my way of leading, you know
what you can do. If I hear any more grumbling I
know what I’ll do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>None the less this spreading doubt and dissatisfaction
on the part of his followers did begin to make impression
upon even so hardened a soul as Rudabaugh’s.
He could do nothing if left alone. Looters always
organize. In spite of his bravado, in spite of the
quantities of fiery liquor which he had consumed, he
began to feel a sudden uncontrollable chill creeping over
his heart. Just now he began to pace up and down,
restlessly endeavoring to work himself into one of his
berserk rages. But he looked over his shoulder once
in a while. No one knew what he saw, unless they
themselves also saw the picture of the two naked women
lying in their blood at a bathing pool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damn it!” said Rudabaugh now, petulantly. “I
don’t see why that bunch of buzzards should pick a
tree so close to light on!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He caught up his rifle. A great black bird dropped
dead from a limb a hundred yards away. The others
rose clumsily, wheeled in dark caravan; but they
alighted on another tree not even so far away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That ain’t luck, I tell you,” repeated the first speaker
of Rudabaugh’s men. “Me, I don’t like the look of
things.”</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>J</span></span>IM NABOURS, who had known but little sleep,
kicked out of his blankets before sunup and
stood, grimy, haggard and moody, his hands in
pockets, his hat pushed back on his head. There was
no familiar sight of a great sea of longhorns rising
just above the level of the grasses. The Del Sol herd
was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the men finished their sodden breakfast in silence.
Only the hysterical sobbings of the black woman Milly
made any variation from the general taciturnity. There
came no word from the tight-closed tilt flaps of the
<span class='it'>carreta</span>. Del Williams and Dalhart had not spoken
to each other since the crossing of the Red. McMasters
paid scarce more attention to any than if they had not
been there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun rose red above the wet grass, climbed
steadily till it seemed smaller; but it did not look down
upon any mass of longhorns rising from the bedding
ground. There was no long procession heading out for
the north. The men of Del Sol were without an
occupation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moody and unhappy, they sat in their bivouac, waiting.
It was McMasters who spoke, suddenly pointing
to the south.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look, Jim,” said he, as he came in and touched
Nabours on the shoulder. “That’s not Indians—that’s
cavalry!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In five minutes proof was complete. There came
into view, company front, at a stiff trot, guidon fluttering
bravely, two troops of the hard-bitten United States
cavalry, then stationed variously on the Plains. An
officer rode in advance. As he came closer there showed
near him the headdress of an Indian warrior, whether
guide, scout or captive, none could say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the sudden relief from their long strain, and under
the influence of this spectacle of riding men, always
inspiriting, the men of Del Sol rose and gave a ragged
shout of welcome to the Yellow Legs. The leader rode
straight on in without any salute or reply; a grim,
grizzled man of forty years or more, in the Western
uniform of our Army when it was at its best. He
dismounted stiffly, came up with military stiffness,
stood on one leg stiffly, looking for the leader. He
kept with him his Indian companion. The Del Sol
men now saw that it was the Comanche chieftain,
Yellow Hand, the partisan of yesterday’s affair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good morning, men,” said the cavalry leader. “I
am Colonel Griswold, from the Sill cantonment down
below. What’re you doing here in the Nations?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good morning,” said Jim Nabours, stepping forward.
“We are shore glad to see you colonel. Well,
we ain’t doing a hell of a lot of anything right now.
Yesterday we was a-driving thirty-six hundred and
fifty-nine fours and mixed stuff north to Alberlene.
That was afore we met yore friend there. We was
just a-strolling through.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, this old thief was just a-strolling through.
I was following him. Last night I saw they had some
fresh beef hides as well as buffalo in their camp. One
thing led to another. I took your trail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They rather busted up your herd, eh? Well, I
brought Yellow Hand along on the chance that he
might be useful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where do you men come from?” he continued.
“Don’t you know that driving cattle across the Indian
Nations is the foolishest thing in the world?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It looks thataway now, colonel,” assented Jim
Nabours. “We come from Caldwell County, Texas,
five hunderd miles south of here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not trading with the tribes in any way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir, we don’t want no truck with them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Got no whisky along?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good God, no!” replied Nabours soulfully. “I
wisht we had.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m,” said the army officer, looking toward the
fire. “You got any coffee left?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some. Set in,” said the foreman simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So invited, Sandy Griswold, seasoned colonel of
cavalrymen, made himself at home, a tin of coffee in
his hand. His eye took in the arrangement of the
scant equipment of these cattle drovers. He noted the
giant carts, their covers drawn tight. He noted also
when the flaps of the nearest cart cover parted, and
some one—at first he thought it was a young man—began
to climb down from the lofty seat via the cart
tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, what’s that?” said Sandy Griswold suddenly.
“That’s no man—that’s a woman!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shore she is,” said Jim Nabours. “She owns the
cows. She’s going through to Aberlene.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By now Taisie Lockart, in blue shirt and checkered
trousers, boots and wide hat—her only apparel—was
approaching the men. The officer arose, hat in hand.
Jim Nabours made such clumsy introduction as he
could. The soldier’s eyes were running over the trim,
straight, round figure of this astonishing apparition.
He saw the great club of bound bright hair, the easy
lines of young womanhood; the poise and grace of as
fine a specimen of young womanhood, indeed, as any
land might well produce. He knew at the first glance
that here was a young lady. She was with this party
but not of it. Her first words affirmed his first conviction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why are you here?” he repeated in wonderment.
“You don’t belong here. This is a man’s job.
Didn’t you know the risk you’d run?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None of us knew very much about it, sir,” rejoined
Taisie Lockhart. “We are beginning now to see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She spread out her hands, indicating the absence of
her herd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit down here by me, please, young lady.” Hat in
hand, he made a place for her. “Which one of these
men did you say was your husband?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bright blood flooded Taisie’s cheeks. Her trail
boss answered for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She won’t be married none till we get to Aberlene,”
said Jim explicitly. “But that ain’t nobody’s fault but
her own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sandy Griswold laughed uproariously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By jove!” said he. “It’s an awful thing to be old
and lame and married—married before you were a
day old, my dear. If I wasn’t, I swear I’d marry you
now, before you’re a day older! What’s the matter
with all these young fellers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His keen blue eye under its shaggy brows swept the
company of the Del Sol men, but found no mate for
her. His eye lingered for just a time on a tall young
man who stood quite apart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come now,” he resumed, turning to the girl from
whose fresh beauty—which was beauty even in daylight,
and even in the morning—his eyes did not willingly
wander long, “tell me all about things. You
don’t belong in here, but of course I have got to help
you out. I wouldn’t fret too much. If I had not come
along old Yellow Hand here would have put you on
your uppers. As it is, we’ll put him on his. We’ll all
go back down the trail together with my bullies yonder.
We’ll hold a big rodeo down there and see what the
buffalo and the Comanches have left for you. Very
foolish of you, my dear; very foolish, indeed. But
we’ll see what can be done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How could we ever pay you?” said Taisie Lockhart,
turning upon him fully now the gaze of her disconcerting
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve more than paid me now, my dear girl,”
said the old warrior. “Lockhart, you said your name
was? What was your father’s name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His name was Burleson Lockhart, sir. He was
colonel of the Ninth Volunteers in the war. We came
from Alabama, once. But my father did not believe
in the secession, though he fought with Texas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I knew him! His regiment and mine were
opposed, in Tennessee!” His voice dropped. “But the
men said you were an orphan. Your father did not
get back from the war?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sudden memory caused her to drop her face in her
hands. Once more her foreman spoke for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Her pap was killed on the Missouri border, after
the war, by the Federal bushwackers up there. He
was driving cows up thataway. Them Yankee people
in Austin have done robbed this girl of everything she
had. We was driving these cows to see if we couldn’t
make a little stake for her oncet more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sandy Griswold sat silent for a time. At last he
spoke quietly to the tall girl who sat on a bed roll
beside him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, now!” he said. “Well now, we’ll see what
can be done. You don’t belong here, but I’d be no sort
of a soldier if I didn’t see you through.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, as though by providential plan, had arrived
unity of purpose and cheerfulness of spirit, an hour
earlier unpredictable. Colonel Sandy Griswold was no
man to delay action. In a half hour the camp was
broken, and the entire party, preceded by the troopers,
was retracing the way south to the scene of yesterday’s
disaster. The commanding officer rode by Taisie Lockhart’s
cart. The ferret eyes of the sullen Comanche
saw now what had been hidden in the <span class='it'>carreta</span>.
Between the cavalry commander and these wild savages
there existed a distinct understanding of some
sort, resting on fear of the troopers’ carbines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to put the whole band to work for
you,” said Griswold, and called his interpreter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Del Sol men found themselves before long
enriched by the recruitment of a couple of dozen laughing
young Indian braves—all of them unarmed—who
for the mere excitement of the thing were ready to
assist in the rounding up of the scattered cattle and
horses. A strangely mixed round-up band they made,
half of them grim and silent, the other half wildly
whooping, when they started off down the trail which
lay written on the grassy soil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As all of them knew, a buffalo stampede was the
worst possible run on the range. But fortune partially
favored the harassed drovers. It soon was evident that
the buffalo had avoided the fringe of timber which
lay ahead, had kept on running into the wind, as was
their custom—alone of all cud chewing game. The
domestic cattle had plunged into the thickets and split
up in the edge of shallow timbered draws, and the
wind meant less to them. This partially combed out the
cattle from the buffalo. Inside of three miles the
riders began to pick up groups and strings of the
cattle in the long dragnet which they swept through
one cover after another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By golly!” exclaimed Jim Nabours suddenly, after
they had ridden an hour or two. “I’ll bet a thousand
dollars there’s old Alamo! If he’s there, there’ll be
more!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was true. A gaunt yellow head crowned with
wide horns stared at them over the thicket tops. Old
Alamo, self-appointed leader of the herd, had concluded
he had gone far enough—indeed, he was willing
to fight to establish that fact now. But the sweep
of the riders driving in the groups of cattle induced
him to change his mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There never were better riders than the Comanches,
and they were hunters as well. The round-up was
sport for them. The wild band helped the trail boss
to pick up one string after another of the scattered
herd, horses mingled with them. One body after
another of the gathering Nabours turned back to the
old encampment where the run had begun. Especially,
he set the Indians to rounding up the horse band, a
task in which they took the most extreme delight. The
joined forces combed out the entire country to the
southeast for perhaps more than ten or fifteen miles
by evening. All day long, under this or that party of
riders, the stream of reclaimed cattle and horses continued,
until even Jim Nabours ceased to grumble
at the product of the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night and yet another night Griswold held his
camp, which included that of the drovers, some two
miles apart from the Comanche village; but his subalterns
day and night had out troops who held the
Comanches under control. There was no outbreak.
The fearless Comanches, feasting full, laughed and
chattered like children. When Nabours reported to
Griswold that he was content to end the rodeo, the tally
showed that the Del Sol herd, cut down as it had
been by the unprecedented losses, still numbered three
thousand and ninety-six head of cattle; and sixty good
riding horses remained in the remuda. They were
pioneers. The term “per cent of loss” was then
unknown on the trail. Later, such losses would have
meant ruin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What cows is left,” said Nabours, “I’ll leave for to
stock the Chickasaw range. As for the lost horses, I
reckon these here Comanches will take care of that
after we are gone. To-morrow I’d like to start on
north. We ain’t got anything too much to eat but
beef, and we mustn’t waste no time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said Griswold. “We’ll all pull north
together in the morning. My supply wagons are up
and I’ll trade you flour and bacon and dried apples for
fresh beef. I’m tired of buffalo. I’ll see you, anyhow,
as far as the Washita crossing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to take Yellow Hand along with me,”
he added. “All these Comanches have got plenty of
meat now, and they’ll stand hitched until he comes
back. I have told them that if they start any funny
business I’m going to shoot Yellow Hand in front of
the whole village.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Send that man over to my tent,” he said to Nabours.
He pointed to McMasters, whose work he had seen.
“I want to talk to him, since I know who he is. If he
is a Texas sheriff and a captain of Texas Rangers he
and I have got to have a little conversation about
Comanches.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They two sat late that night in front of Griswold’s
tent, talking by the little fire. When they parted the
soldier gave the young Ranger a strong clasp of the
hand. What they had said no one but themselves
knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now, when the pink dawn of the prairie again
came above the dewy grasses, there might be seen
once more the sea of wide horns, in the old comfortable
morning picture of the trail; the trail of days now
gone by forever.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='253' id='Page_253'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXIX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A MAID’S MISTAKE</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>D</span></span>IMINISHED but undaunted, the great herd
swept north once more into the wide, sweet,
unknown world. The mingled grasslands and
narrow timber tracts which lay between the heads of
the water courses made for cattle drovers a land of
plenty where man had not yet come. In every hollow
the wild deer sprang away, the head of every draw
contained its flocks of great wild turkeys. On the
grassy flats were uncounted coveys of the prairie
grouse. The air was enlivened with the wild calls
of the giant sickle-billed curfew; and from above
came the mysterious, baffling liquid tremolo of the
upland plover, honey sweet to hear. Glossy green parakeets
showed in the timber mottes, meadow larks
made gay the air with their metallic clankings, mixed
with the broken strains of melody all their own.
There was life, motion, all the time in the wild landscape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The vegetable world also was rich, richer than our
Government had thought when in ignorance it gave
this domain to the savages in a treaty which, like all
our treaties, later was to be repealed. Fruits began
to appear, few of them yet ripening; wild grapes,
plums. They crossed one strip of sand dunes which
ran through the grassy knolls, and found an astonishing
growth of dwarfed grapevines, showing not more
than a foot or so above the sand, but promising fruit
of great size.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the timbered valleys there was an admirable
growth of elms, cottonwoods, black walnuts. Haws
and persimmons, not yet ripe, young acorns of the oak
trees, showed what the fall mast would be. The
black bears and the deer even now were hunting mushrooms.
Abundance of food was there for every species.
The spotted wildcat made no unusual sight. Now
and then a panther passed ghostlike from one covert to
the next. A rich land and a contented, indolent,
assured. The white men had not yet come. Nor
was there even here either weed or bee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though really near the eastern edge of their range
of that day, distant bands of the buffalo still showed;
and adding yet keener zest to an enlivened landscape,
frequent bands of wild horses passed in their easy
drifting over the grasslands, or stood at gaze in superb
confidence in their own speed. It was the open country,
the free country, of the old West. In it these men
were as much adventurers as had been the sailors of
Columbus or Cabot, Leif Ericson or Magellan. It
had taken three Army expeditions and a half century
of time to find the head of the Red River, which made
the drovers’ Rubicon. Young in the youth of their
world, they exulted as they rode.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Colonel Sandy Griswold quit the saddle for the jolting
cart seat to which Nabours had banished Taisie
Lockhart. The wilderness makes swift friendships.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear,” said the soldier to the girl one day as
they rode, joltingly along. “I wouldn’t ask anything
better than just to ride along this way with you forever.
You are by no means painful to the naked eye,
and within sixty days you will be rich. Abilene is
not a dream, although it is just beginning. Two railroads
are going west across the lower Plains now. They
are going to make a cattle market at Abilene and you
are in on the ground floor. Rich? Are you going to
support a husband? You could, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I’ll buy myself some clothes the first thing
I’ll do,” said Taisie, slowly smiling, “if there is such
a thing as women’s clothes at Abilene.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There you go! Woman’s first instinct. Tell me”—suddenly—“where
is that tall young man—you know
which one I mean. You don’t know where he is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think he’s back behind to-day. He’s not regularly
on the herd—now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t know very much, do you, my dear?
You’d let a brave, square man ride on the drag?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please don’t, I beg of you! I don’t really know
why you mention him. My men all are splendid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he went on relentlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; and I suppose you know that your men are
riding his horses—that you are eating his food yourself?
Did you know that he staked you for this
drive—that he is going to make your fortune for you?
No, you never knew that. But that’s true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, don’t tell me such things!” broke out Taisie
in swift consternation. “I never knew that! Of course
I never knew it! I’d never have gone a foot! Oh,
this is an awful thing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, my dear; there are awful things that a woman
can do to a man, too. Now that it is too late it would
be quite like a woman for you to love him. You ought
to have trusted him in the first place. You can’t fool
with a man like that. He’s cold iron.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He didn’t—he wouldn’t—don’t you think—do you
suppose—why, what can I do? I’ve been unjust. Yes,
I know that now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I wouldn’t climb down out of this cart right
now anyhow,” said Colonel Griswold calmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I can’t go on this way. What shall I do? Rich?
No, I’m a pauper! And I’ve not a soul in all the world
to go to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, you have, my dear! Observe me beat on
my chest. I, Sandy Griswold, will save this maiden
in distress! But it’s always best to get the truth, the
first thing. Well, you’ve got it now. You never would
have learned it unless I had told you. That young man
would rather cut his throat than tell you what I have
told you. He never dreamed I would. But I thought
it right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I can’t go on this way!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have got to go on in this way, my dear. There
is nothing else for you to do. When that man says
he is through he is through. He’s got the chief ingredients
of a bad man. But there never was a bad man
who didn’t have good things about him. That sort of
a man can’t alter a decision. He thinks once, acts once,
is done once and for all, and when he’s done he’s done.
I can’t help you with him. But what a splendid pair of
human beings you have spoiled!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A fine prospect you give me, sir! Oh, you are
comforting!” said Taisie Lockhart bitterly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will be very hard for a girl like you not to marry
some man. It is a very terrible thing to marry the
wrong man, my dear. It’s a very terrible thing to let
a man think you meant to marry him when you didn’t.
It’s the worst when a man wants to marry and can’t—because
he can’t forgive an insult to his honor. It is
lucky you are not a man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, less lucky that I am woman! I shall choke at
the thought of eating his bread!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, you won’t. That’s melodrama, my dear.
If you don’t like his flour eat some of mine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, keep your eyes closed and your mouth closed,
too, until you get to Abilene. I may meet you or send
for you up there myself. That’s what the Army’s for—we’re
organized to help damsels in distress. That
you are in distress I know very well indeed. While
there’s a sack of flour or an ambulance mule left—well,
we’ll see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the encampment of the last night below the
Washita, Taisie Lockhart might well have felt a sense
of security. There were two troops of cavalry and all
her own men bivouacked about her. But she could not
sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon after dark that night Dan McMasters, asking
no consent and giving no notification, quietly rose and
caught up his night horse. He disappeared in the darkness
headed toward the ford. He said no word of
good-by to any one, and was not missed by any one—save
by one unhappy girl who had lacked his coming
all these days. She was sure she hated him—when
she reasoned. When she did not reason she felt her
veins run hot with love of him. He had kissed her.
Their arms had encircled one another. Ah, obligations?</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='258' id='Page_258'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>MANY TRANSACTIONS</span></h1></div>

bedded down in their compact oblong, willing
to rest after two days’ hard march. Nabours
had doubled the night guard. The men in pairs rode
in reverse around and around the herd, passed and
repassed slowly, regularly, singing the cradle song of
the cows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours, worn by long hours, early pulled his
blankets over his face. Cinquo Centavos himself dozed
under his ragged quilt, in his dreams comforted with
the subconscious tinkling of the gray mare’s bell. In
the cavalry camp, a half mile away, all was quiet save
for the methodical tramp of the sentinels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Midnight. Jim Nabours felt a strong hand laid on
his shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush!” whispered a voice. “It’s McMasters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s wrong?” demanded the foreman, flying off
his blanket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rudabaugh’s gang will jump us in less than half
an hour. Get all the men up. I am going to tell the
soldiers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The loud challenge of a sentinel halted him, but soon
he was admitted in the cavalry camp. Griswold was
up at once. McMasters put before him a hurried
report.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re ahead about four or five miles,” he
explained; “camped on the Washita. One of their
hunters saw us to-day. He had just got in when I
made the edge of their camp. I was close enough to
their camp to hear them talking. But I don’t think
he knew the soldiers were here. He must just have
seen some of our cattle. Of course they know what
herd it is. There are about twenty of them. They’re
going to try to surprise us. You’ll help us surprise
them, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Griswold rubbed his chin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I don’t know that the U. S. Army has any
special cause to act as a police posse in a family row;
but I suppose I’ll have to throw in with you. Fine
place for a woman, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had no reply to that. But a few moments later
Taisie Lockhart heard steps approaching her cart. She
put out her head to answer Nabours’ hurried call; saw
McMasters and Griswold also standing close. Nabours
announced the plan already made by these three.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s danger, Miss Taisie. The Rudabaugh gang
is coming. They’ll come right to your cart the first
thing, like enough. Hand us out that chest. We’re
going to hide it under the beds by the fire. Come on
with us. The men are all up now. Crawl into any
bed you see and get all the blankets and saddles around
you that you can. You’ll be safer there than here.
They want what’s in that box.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An instant later, fastening her jacket, she ran, but
turned back. McMasters was not coming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you,” she began—“where are you going?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going back to get in your cart,” said he.
“That will probably be where they’ll head in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Apparently he did not hear her speak again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under Griswold’s military orders now, two long
curving lines of soldiers and trail men were spread
out, leaving a wide opening at the end where the attack
was to be expected. The orders were that each man
was to lie flat in the grass and not to fire until the
invaders were well inside the lines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps a quarter of an hour passed, a half hour.
The herd still slept well. The riders, duly warned,
kept up their crooning. The embers of the fire smoldered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly the strain of vigilance was broken. The
night air was rent by the shrill yell of the Comanche
war whoop!</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was no war cry of the attacking party. It was
only the devilish fashion that old Yellow Hand, close
guarded, had chosen to appraise approaching invaders
of his own presence and of his defiance of the men
who held him captive. Whatever he expected to gain
by his bravado, the wily old Iago got quick results
in a swinging blow at the side of his head from a
cavalry carbine which laid him out for the rest of the
fight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fight, of course, was on at once; the keen ears
of the savage had detected the presence of the enemy
between the two lines of guards. The night went alight
in slanting streaks of rifle fire. There was general
mêlée. The Del Sol men and the troopers could make
out little, except that their enemy was between the jaws
of the trap that had been set for them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One man of the assailants, unsuspected, had crawled
close to the cart where Taisie Lockhart had slept. When
the yell of the reckless savage broke the air—followed
by the general rattle of musketry—there came the roar
of the startled herd once more stampeding in the
night. No cattle could stand under this. In this
increase of the confusion the crawling invader arose
and made a rush toward the cart. There came two
red flashes from the front flap. The man fell forward
and lay motionless. For a second time Rudabaugh
had failed to get his coveted title to uncounted
Texas acres. At the same hands, another of his
boldest men had fallen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the rear of the cook cart came the roar of a
Sharpe Berdan. Cinquo had gone into action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I got him! I got one!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy began to crawl out from under the cart,
hastening to where he saw something lying in the
grass. He had lain close to the spot where the mistress
of Del Sol lay bundled up in blankets; and he
had thrown around her a barricade of every saddle
he could find, combined with every roll of blankets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A bugle sounded, the signal for the two lines to
close in. When they heard the rush of many feet on
both sides of them Rudabaugh and his men knew that
they were trapped by vastly superior numbers. Not
many of them were left standing. Of these, all now
sought quarter. There came cries of, “Don’t shoot!
We surrender!” But the Del Sol men, fearing
treachery, were merciless. When they had crowded together
the remainder of the bandits the trail men
rushed upon them with pistol butts and quirts and
rifle barrels. The few left alive were roped and
bound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the score of assailants only two remained alive
and uncaptured—Rudabaugh and the crafty man known
as Baldy. Crouching low, they got off in the grass
at the best speed they could muster, and until tally was
made at the camp fire no one missed them. Not until
daylight, indeed, could the full list of fatalities be
determined. For the defenders there was but one
casualty—Al Pendleton, who had got a shot through
the leg and was disabled for the time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What had been a trail camp was now anything but
that. The men gathered their prisoners closer to the
fire, built it up. A trooper dragged up Yellow Hand,
barely conscious, sullen and silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here is your friend, gentlemen,” said Griswold
grimly to the surviving men of the attacking party.
“He did all he could for you. I ought to blow his
brains out, and yours out, too, and I’ve a damned
good mind to do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned toward Dan McMasters, who had come
to the fireside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now about these men,” he said, “I am going to
take them out with me on a charge of killing those
Indian women down near the Arbuckles. They’re
accessories anyway. I’ve got no jurisdiction and no
warrant, and it isn’t my business; but what’s the Army
for? Now about this old thief, I’m going to ask him
a few questions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He jerked Yellow Hand roughly to his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come here, Danny,” he called out to his interpreter.
“Tell this old liar I want to ask him some questions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Says he don’t want to talk,” began the interpreter,
as the savage grunted a few sullen syllables.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell him he’s got to talk. Ask him this: Ask him,
suppose white man come into camp and shoot two
women, what does Comanche warrior do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Says Comanche warrior catch white man some
day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell him the chief of these people that came into
our camp ran away like a coyote in the grass. Tell
him that man, last week, he shoot two Comanche
women, just to see them kick. Yellow Hand tried
to be the friend to-night of the man who shoots
Comanche women. Yellow Hand acts not like a chief
but like a foolish person.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rapid and excited conversation for some time
between the interpreter and the warrior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Says Yellow Hand and his men shot a few buffalo.
The Kiowas said all right. Says he’s good Indian.
Says white man tie him up and knock him in the
head. Says holler just now in the dark because he
feel good. Says he don’t know who come. Says
if it’s all right for white man to try Comanche, then
all right for Comanche to try white man. Says suppose
if that man killed two Comanche women, then
white man catch him for Comanche. Then Comanche
try him plenty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How! How!” exclaimed Griswold. “Then they’d
be willing to forget that I asked Yellow Hand to ride
with me a while?” Griswold’s face was animated.
He was working out some plan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The interpreter replied, after translating some
Comanche and Spanish mixed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Says, yes, sure. Comanches like this country.
Comanches no want to fight. Says his young men
will have bad hearts if they find two of their women
killed. Says s’pose warrior gets killed—all right.
S’pose woman gets killed, that’s plenty bad shame.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ask him what people this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Griswold suddenly held up before Yellow Hand’s
face the two moccasins which McMasters had brought
with him from the Arbuckle Trail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old savage looked once, twice, closely. His face
underwent an astonishing change—was convulsed with
surprise, grief, anger. He gave but one ejaculation
and drew his blanket across his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Says his people! Says his family—his squaws!
He know them shoe!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yellow Hand! Yellow Hand!” The officer shook
the old chief roughly by the shoulder. “Listen to
me! Chief of the Comanches, this is our council now!
Me, I talk!” The soldier stripped back the blanket
from the Comanche’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yellow Hand, for years we have been trying to
get you to stop killing our people on the Staked
Plains. The Great Father has always fought you
fair. The Great Father never killed your women. The
Great Father will put his blanket over his face when
he hears of this thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen Yellow Hand! Chiefs do not break their
word. If we follow the man who did that—that man
who ran away—and bring him to you and give him
to your people to try him in your village will you think
that the Great Father is just in his heart?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Says yes, he would.” The interpreter had made it
plain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen, Yellow Hand! I have been trying to make
treaty with you. I have been trying to get a great
piece of land here where the game is plenty for the
Comanches and the Kiowas, a place where they could
sit down. You have not answered me about that. I
have followed you. I have fed you. I have not killed
your women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen, Yellow Hand! The white men are going
west into your hunting country. The white men are
coming north here. You see them. My young men
with long knives are coming out too. They will
surround you, as many as leaves on the trees. You can
never kill them all. They have guns that shoot seven
days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen, Yellow Hand! When the buffalo are gone
you will be hungry. I gave you a great piece of land.
I asked you to sit down. I gave you a treaty. I make
no war now on the Comanches or the Kiowas. I will
give you a good place, many miles, down by the
mountains of the Wichitas, where there is much
game.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen, Yellow Hand! Tell him to answer me,
Danny! If I do all this for you, and if I bring that
man back who killed your women, will the Comanches
come in and sit down by the side of the Kiowas in this
country where all around them are the men of the
other tribes, who have taken treaty with the Great
Father? Tell him to answer, damn him, Danny!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yellow Hand himself sprang to his feet, cast off his
blanket and stood now the Indian warrior and orator.
Chief of a people, he spoke to an audience who understood
him not, an audience who sat about him in the
dark; but the fire of his words showed his conviction,
made him understandable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Says he is ready to be killed. Says he tells the
truth. Says his heart is sad because his women have
been killed. Says if you will bring him in the man that
did that, then he will be good Indian. Says he will
make treaty. Says he will sit down by the side of his
friends, the Kiowas. Says he will do nothing now
without asking the Great Father. Says he has nothing
more to say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How! How!” exclaimed the officer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He reached out and took the hand of the Comanche
in his own. Then he turned toward McMasters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dead or alive, we’ve got to have that man Rudabaugh.
Do you know what that means? The man who
can do that will be of more use to Texas than almost
any man Texas ever produced. That means the end of
the Comanche war. That means the Comanches will
take a reservation in the Nations. Even Indians have
some idea of actual justice. Dead or alive, I want
Rudabaugh!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take him away, men.” He nodded to his top
sergeant. “Feed this man well. Give him coffee,
give him sugar, give him anything we’ve got. Build
up the fire. This is one good night’s work!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He continued his talk to McMasters, pacing up and
down in his excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we could make peace for Texas, if we could
clear the western border for settlement—why, we’d be
preparing a cattle trail clear across the Staked Plains!
Other herds? You can be sure more are going to
follow yours, farther west, as soon as the road is
clear. I’d rather fight Indians than feed them any
day, but if I’ve got to do both I am going to do them
both on the square.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now I want Rudabaugh. When we’ve brought him
in we have done more for the cowmen of Texas than
all the railroads and all the United States Government
ever yet have done. Little things sometimes run into
big ones; good may come out of an evil deed. I want
to see that low-down brute who killed those women.
The sight of his face is a thing right dear to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yellow Hand,” he said, once more addressing the
Comanche, “your hands are no longer tied. In the
morning go back to your people. You shall ride alone
if you wish. Tell your people that I am going back
to my own village at the Wichita hills and sit down.
Tell them I will not follow the Comanches this summer.
Tell them that my young men are following the men
who killed the women of the Comanches. All these
men are going on the war trail. They will not rest
until they bring back that man.” And thus spoke
Danny to the chief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, sunny days and starry nights to you, my
dear!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old soldier turned to Anastasie Lockhart. Her
troubled eyes looked into his an instant. He would
not listen to her stammering attempt at thanks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A bugle sounded. The troops took formation, rode
away, jaunty guidon at the head; a waif of silk in a
buckskin land, themselves waifs of fortune, doing their
duty unseen on the far frontier, with thanks of no one
and criticism from all. They were men of the Army
which had saved a country and now was finding one—our
Army—never understood; one day, to-day, our
day, ignorantly to be despised.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>“It looks like you was riding, too,” commented
Nabours. He nodded to the saddled horse of McMasters,
the additional horse with light pack, whose
lariat was thrown over the saddle horn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said McMasters in his cold and noncommittal
way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you didn’t have to go. The men don’t want
to see you go. It’s only kind of hard for them to say
so. But afore you do ride north—and I reckon I
know why you do—I wisht you’d sort of give me some
idee of the country ahead. You’ve heard or seen more
of it than I ever have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McMasters took a stick and began to make a map
in the smoothed ashes of the camp fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to help you over the Washita,” he said:
“but you won’t find that a very bad crossing—steep
banks, and swift, but narrow. You’d better make some
sort of raft and get the carts across.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The next big river is the main Canadian, not so
far above here. It’ll be dry, always very little water
in it. It’s bone-dry sometimes for a hundred miles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The North Fork of the Canadian—it runs here—is
the crookedest river out of doors. It carries more
water than the big river. You will probably have to
swim some there, but you ought to make it all right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll get through the blackjack country, and then
you’ll come up to the Cimarron-easy fording. Just
beyond that you’ll be somewhere close to latitude thirty-six.
You might then almost say you are getting out of
the South and into the North.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father and old Colonel Lockhart always used
to talk to me about wintering all their cattle just under
that line. They said that would make them free of
sticks for the next season. Some longhorns took fever
even as far north as Illinois. It didn’t make Texas
popular.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, when you get north of 36—here’s where it
runs—you have only got the Salt Fork of the Arkansas
between you and the main Arkansas. It comes
out of Kansas not so very far from where you’ll hit
the Kansas line.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It sounds right far,” said Jim Nabours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes: when you get up in there you’re coming into
the edge of a thousand miles of open range, the best
cattle ground out of doors; and there isn’t a cow
in it from one end to the other. That country’s waiting
for cows. It needs them as much as our cows need a
market.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you’ll find out all these things as you come
to them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Always scant of speech, he turned away, swung into
the saddle. Reaching down he held out a hand to
Cinquo, the boy herder, who had followed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We done saved her, Mister Sher’f,” said the boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Dan McMasters did not cast a glance back of
him to the white-topped cart which made the only
home of Taisie Lockhart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” said Jim Nabours, turning to his own
horse, “everybody can start like he pleases except
us. Afore I need a map I need some cows. Come on,
men, we got to foller out one more run. Lucky if
we get seven and a half cows to Aberlene.”</p>

next.” Nabours spoke with a half sigh in
his voice. The departure of McMasters and
of the soldiers had left a strange feeling of loneliness
among the Del Sol men. They began to brood, to lose
morale. This was after two more days of riding,
combing cattle out of the timber along the Washita,
which very luckily had caught and left partly nugatory
the last run of the much harassed herd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hour was not yet late; and although the tired
trail hands had little enough of sleep, there was no
active murmuring, and the order of the day once more
began, the long line of longhorns stringing out, the
guides on either side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cattle paced on methodically enough, but the
arrival at the Washita was so late in the day that the
trail boss concluded not to cross until the following
morning. They found the banks as McMasters had
said—high and steep; and the river had swimming
water. But much to their joy they found a good-sized
raft which some one, probably Rudabaugh and
his men, for reasons of their own, had spent some time
and care in building.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, there won’t many of them need it now,” commented
Nabours, “and we do. That’s the first luck
we’ve had. I’m scared to swim that girl again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They crossed the carts without difficulty in the morning,
and the entire herd swam over easily, a narrow
trail being plain on the other side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more on their way, and with the Washita
behind them, a certain feeling of light-heartedness came
to the trail drovers. They sang cheerily to their cows
as they rode alongside, caught the feel of the new
country lying on ahead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The weather was not unfavorable, but in the afternoon
the older trail men began to look at the sky.
There was a dull, lifeless feeling in the air. The wind
had ceased. A bank of clouds lay black in the lower
west.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It may rain,” said Jim Nabours, coming over to
Taisie’s near-by camp after the herd was turned off
to bed down. “You and your women, Miss Taisie,
had better sleep in the carts to-night. I hope to the
Lord our little dogies won’t take a notion to run
again to-night! This herd’s getting plumb spoiled.
Before long they’ll run every time a feller lights a
cigarrito.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look as that lightning in west, Jim,” remarked Cal
Dalhart. “It’s worse than cigarritos. I hope she’ll
pass around.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the prairie storm did not intend to pass around
them. They lay directly in the center of a low barometer.
The air was oppressively hot, so still that a leaf
would have fallen straight to the ground; yet the
face of the western cloud was lit with continuous electrical
discharges. An uneasiness came into the air
that even the cattle felt. The greenhead flies had
swarmed in the grass all day. Now clouds of mosquitoes
made life a burden for men and beasts. It was
hard to bed the cattle down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Set the wagon tongues on the North Star, boys,
while you can see it,” said Jim Nabours. The dark
cloud was steadily rising. “This is going to be one
hell of a night. You’ll need your slickers. Look
yonder! I’ve heard tell about that sort of a thing,
but I’ve never saw it afore.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pointed toward the bed ground. In the strange
electrical condition of the air the horns of each steer
showed two little balls of flame, thousands of them
in the total, a strange and awesome sight in the gloom.
As the night watch rode later they saw electricity on
the tips of their horses’ ears. It almost dripped from
the air; the earth seemed bathed in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At midnight the stars passed away under a high
vanguard of scurrying clouds. The strange tensity in
the air increased as continuous rolls of thunder came
closer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve all got to get on the herd,” said Nabours
finally. “There’s going to be trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men all mounted their night horses and made
ready. There came to them all a feeling of pygmylike
incompetency as the edge of the storm extended itself
as though with some inner propelling power. The
wind had not yet begun. They knew they were in for
one of the terrible electrical storms of the prairies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The steady flashes of lightning along the cloud face
broke into jagged forks. Intermittent among these
came short bolts of the chain lightning. A smell of
sulphur filled the air. A strange blue tint seemed to
come into some of the lightning bolts. At times there
seemed to be a continuous sheet of fire along the grass
tops towards the west. This later was broken by balls
of fire which rolled along the ground, exploding like
bombshells. There seemed nothing in the air except
light; sparks and whirls and wheels of light, like so
many pin wheels. A strange, alarming, oppressive feel,
as though of a settling fog, came upon them all. If a
man reached a hand to his hat brim the electricity
literally dripped from it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rarely, even on the high prairies, did the tremendous
electrical disturbances ever reach such violence; not
one of these hardened range men had ever seen the
like of this. But to the wonder of all the cattle did
not at once make any break. They seemed stupefied
themselves. They now all were on their feet, but in the
continuous succession of blinding flashes on every side,
the crash of thunder coming from all quarters, they
could form no course for running and stood rooted
in sheer terror. Nor was there a man who did not
think his own end had come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The climax came in a straight bolt from above,
which struck and exploded directly in the middle of the
herd. The detonation was as though a giant shrapnel
shell had dropped. Twenty cattle were killed outright.
Two horses dropped. A rider was smitten dead,
another came out of the shock dazed and for some
hours stone deaf. The old Mexican, Sanchez, had a
fashion of wearing a pair of ancient spectacles. They
were burned from his ears, only the bow between the
rims remaining, and that burned deep into his nose.
Len Hersey boasted a fancy tie with a stickpin, once
bought in better days. The gold was melted from it,
the stone dropped in the grass. The nap of his sombrero
was singed smooth. A score of unbelievable phenomena,
a series of miraculous escapes came all at
once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This last exploding bolt, so disastrous in its effect,
was more than any herd could stand. The cattle started
like a covey of quail. The universe seemed in dissolution.
There was nothing for the men to do but
follow as best they could. It was as safe in one place
as in another, and of shelter there was none. Never
was a wilder ride than that night; for now, with
a rush and steady roar, came the wind and the slanting
rain. The encampment at the bed ground was afloat,
deserted. Old Milly put out her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Taisie! Miss Taisie!” she called. She got no
answer. “My Lord! she done killed!” she called out
to Anita.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then arose her lamentations continuously as she lay
in her drenched blankets. They two were all that
remained. Even Buck was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The run in a general way had headed north. A
couple of miles ahead, between them and the Canadian
River, lay a little boggy creek lined with thickets.
Suddenly enlarged by the rain, it overflowed and made
very soft footing for fifty or a hundred yards. Into
this boggy trap the animals plunged in their madness.
Within a few moments a third of the herd was bogged
down. An inexplicable confusion took place among the
others. No man could do anything here. The riders
only followed such strings of cattle as they could
hear farther down the stream. They all knew that
when daylight came they would have their work to
do in salvaging from the quagmire. Most of them
tried to find their way back to camp, and those who
made it sat huddled, drenched, as the weird flame-edged
clouds passed on. Until dawn, they never knew there
was a dead man lying in the grass on the bed ground
three hundred yards from the camp, among the dead
cattle and horses. Well, it was another grave; and
this made the first duty of the day. They put up the
third little headboard. So passed Al Pendleton.
Though crippled by his gunshot wound, he had insisted
on taking saddle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the work of snaking out bogged cattle—the
most unwelcome of all range work—must go forward
along the muddy stream, hour after hour, as soon as
the depressing dawn gave light for the beginning. The
waters falling, some of the cattle struggled ashore
as soon as they could see. Others needed but little
help, a few had to be abandoned. In this work of
roping and dragging, it took two men to handle a
steer. As soon as one of the wild creatures got his
feet he was certain to charge his rescuer. Hard work,
dirty work, dangerous work; slow, utterly disheartening.
But it was here to be done. Once more, slowly,
a battered and begrimed cohort of broad horns began
to assemble, watched by tired, muddy, cursing men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sinker,” called Nabours to the boy as he came
by coiling his muddy rope in the gray cold dawn, “you
go on and find Dalhart, and ride back to camp. I don’t
know where the rest of the horses went. Drive in
what cows you find. It ain’t so far. Tell the cook
we’ll be in for a little coffee, some of us, right soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These two, so commanded, came into camp only to
learn the news from Milly. The bed of Taisie Lockhart
was empty. Her horse was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll bet I know!” said Cinquo. “I’ll bet she follered
the remuda in the dark!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was off, following the plain trail of the running
horses, Dalhart at his side. They rode hard for a
mile. The horses had struck timber, slowed up and
scattered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see her!” called out the boy at last. “That’s her
zebry horse anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The white-banded son of Blancocito was not to be
mistaken. But the saddle was empty! At the foot
of a near-by tree lay the object which they sought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was alive, was sitting up, propped against a
tree trunk; indeed, was on the point of mounting.
So much they saw with sudden joy as they flung down
and ran to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man pushed the boy away roughly. Kneeling,
Dalhart caught the girl in his arms, uttering impetuous
words. What he saw filled Cinquo with shame and
horror. This man had touched the divinity of Del
Sol! He was holding her in his arms! He was going
to kiss her! Sacrilege!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cinquo saw flame points. He sprang forward, his
long revolver in his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, you! You let go of her, mister! Stop now,
or I’ll stop you for shore!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy was blubbering in his excitement, but as
Dalhart turned he saw that the aim of the weapon
was true. Taisie beat at him with her hands, weakly,
pushing him away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll wring your neck!” began Dalhart, starting
toward the boy. Only the girl’s voice saved them one
or both.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! No!” she called. “He means well! Cinquo,
come here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dalhart turned to her almost savagely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You promised me!” he said. “You gave me your
word down there! Is this how you keep your promise?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But between the two of them, the girl with her
tears and the boy with his revolver, Cal Dalhart got
on very ill with his wooing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can wait,” said he slowly at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his sobbing excitement the boy was dangerous
as a rattlesnake, and Dalhart was wise enough to
know it. Only one voice could calm him. Taisie
spoke with decision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Throw down your gun, Cinquo! Drop it, I tell
you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cinquo obeyed. His tears came freely now. He
trembled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Trouble with me is, ma’am,” said he, “I got chills
and fever. To-day I got ’em both. I been up all
night. I don’t give a damn for that man, but this here
is awful hard for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cinquo,” said Taisie, putting her hand on his
grimy shirt sleeve as she drew him beside her, “you
are as good a man as I’ve got. Listen now! I’m not
hurt. I just ran into a tree in the dark and got knocked
out of the saddle. For a long time I didn’t know
anything—my head’s bruised; but I was going to get
up and ride right soon. Now go and find the horses;
they’re not far. I saw the bell mare just below.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy, shivering in his saddle, racked by the
native ague, went off dully about his duties. He cast
an eye over his shoulder, saw Dalhart riding close
to the side of the mistress of Del Sol.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The trouble with you is,” broke out Dalhart
moodily, “you don’t know how a man can love you—you
don’t know how I love you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He reached out a hand to touch the bridle of her
saddle horse, which flung its head impatiently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I do,” said Taisie slowly. “You love me
like a man. They’re all alike.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe you do love that damned Gonzales renegade.
He’s gone again, and he may come back, or he
may not. What you need is a man to take care of
you; some one better than that cold-blooded killer
that ain’t got a heart for either man or woman!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop! I tell you I want to hear no more of this!”
The girl’s voice had in it a quiet fury. “At least I
never have heard that man say a word against you or
any one else. If he’s a killer he’d face his man, I’m
sure of that, and not curse him behind his back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’d better not say anything about me,” Dalhart
blustered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Taisie Lockhart’s contemptuous laugh at that
was the cruelest thing he had ever heard in all his life.
She spurred on and left him.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Dribbles of the herd continued to come in. The
draggled encampment was slow to take on even a little
order. The men had begun to lose confidence, to
dread their luck. And now was time for a repetition of
the scene on the south bank of the Red—another rider
must find burial in his blankets. Never had the spirits
of the men been so low, the hope of success so faint,
the savage irritability of all so unmistakable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It took a day and a half to finish the unhappy duties
of the last camp below the Canadian and drive forward
the remade herd. It was necessary to follow down the
boggy stream to find a sound crossing. Beyond, within
a mile or so, lay the main Canadian. Here at least
they met no trouble. The spongelike sands had
swallowed up the torrents until only an occasional
thread of lazily trickling water marked the wide expanse
from bank to bank. The cattle, warm and
thirsty, seemed disposed to break ranks and explore
these little trickles of water, so that the men had
enough to do. Dalhart rode moodily, indifferently,
on his point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damn it, man!” called Del Williams to him, approaching
him after one more chase after a wisp of
stragglers. “I’d think you could ’tend to your own end
part ways somehow!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the first time he had spoken to Dalhart in
days. Their enmity was smoldering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t need any help from anybody about handling
cows,” retorted the other; “least of all from you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Del Williams rode straight up to him at what seemed
a challenge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see you for no cowman, myself,” said
he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They sat face to face midway of the dry river
bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to know what you mean,” said Dalhart.
“I’ve been as good a hand on this trail as you have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think so. Nothing but luck kept you from
drownding that girl crossing the Red. More than
that, it was you that let logs come through the cattle
when they was swimming the day before. That
started the mill. Four hundred cows lost and two men
drownded. You was upriver side of the herd.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was mortal affront, as Del Williams was willing
that it should be. At the time both men were unarmed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know I won’t stand that,” said Dalhart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You heard it plain,” rejoined Williams quietly.
“Make your play any time you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, I will make it! We both said we’d hold
off till we struck Abilene. We’ll not both ride south
together,” said Dalhart savagely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope not,” smiled Del Williams. “I have got
plenty of grief riding in sight of you going north.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Neither man liked to be the first to back his horse.
Their actions caught the sight of Nabours, who started
back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here!” he began. “What are you two doing
here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” began Dalhart, “he told me I wasn’t doing
my work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then he told you plumb right. Look at you now,
both of you. You two give me your word, both of
you, that you’d quit this quarreling till you got to Aberlene.
Now quit it or else get out. If a little more
happens I am going to get on the prod my own self.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They separated. Del Williams later approached Nabours,
both moody, sore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jim,” said he, “look at the luck! Could anything
more happen to us? I tell you, there’s a Jonah somewheres
on this herd.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There shore is!” rejoined the harried foreman.
“There shore is! And it’s got red hair.”</p>

weather has undeniable influence. Came now a
bright sun and gentle winds. The prairie lay
like a silver sea. The surliness of the men vanished,
they were children again. Once more the force of
custom, of duty, made itself felt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One more camp brought them to the North Fork of
the Canadian, a more serious proposition than had
been the main river of that name. The channel was
narrower and deeper, and the banks, especially upon
the south side, much more steep. There was only a
narrow channel of swimming water, but not a man in
the outfit would have consented to see the mistress
of Del Sol undertake to swim her own horse across
even the narrowest channel. The entire herd was
held up for half a day while the men make a rude
raft sufficient to cross the carts and their occupants.
They dug down the bank on the farther shore so that
better egress might be offered for the cattle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the time a cow has swum a river,” said Jim
Nabours to expostulating men, who did not like
shovel work, since that, at least, could not be done
on horseback, “he’s plumb tired, like enough. Make
him climb a steep bank and he may fall back in. The
worst place for them to get crowded is on the far side
of a river. Now you fellows go on and dig a nice path,
or else maybe we won’t have no cows a-tall before long.
I’m scared to make a tally, way it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they passed yet another unknown river and
swung on out, their own trail makers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish to God I knowed where we was,” grumbled
the trail boss to Len Hersey, carefree cowhand, to
whom he happened to be talking. “Unless’n that wagon
tongue has got warped we’re still heading north. I
done set her on the North Star last night my own self.
But a trail scout had orto have a watch and a compass,
and there ain’t nary one of either in this whole outfit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hersey took a chew of tobacco.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heap o’ things in life ain’t needful,” said he; “just
only folks gets used to them, that’s all. That lead
steer Alamo’s all right if nobody don’t move the North
Star. He’s got his eye sot on that. I seen him standing
up the other night about one o’clock, looking at that
star with one eye. He done wink at me with the other
one. He shore knows where we’re at, Jim. You’d
oughtn’t to worry. This suits me, although I will
say that this here shirt I got now might be a little
better around the elbows. I hate to go to meeting in
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I was a boy,” said Nabours reminiscently,
“the onliest kind of church we had was camp meeting.
I ain’t saw one of them for quite a while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Them big meetings used to bring in everybody
from all over. The preacher’d throw the camp in some
nice grove, and folks would build a shed with a brush
roof and make some seats out of slabs. That was the
church. I’ve saw a bearskin used for a pulpit cover.
If there was extra ministers on hand, sometimes they’d
have rawhide-bottom chairs made for them. The
mourner’s bench, it always had a good rawhide bottom
too. There used to be plenty straw scattered around
between the benches for the sake of them that got
conviction right strong and begun to throw fits. What
with horses and dogs and babies, there was quite a
settlement to a good camp meeting, while it lasted. The
men didn’t always have hats and the women couldn’t
always afford calico, but I can’t see but what we got
along all right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Them days a feller had to load a rifle at the front
end exclusive—no Henry rifles then. It was perlite for
to lean your shooting iron against a tree and hang your
powder horn on it before you went in to get religion.
My pap always taken a drink of corn licker afore he set
in; but he always put down a gourdful of cold water
on top of it, so it didn’t hurt him none, he told me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I recollect when we built the first log school in the
valley. It was about ten foot square. But come to
style, the courthouse up to Sherman, twenty years ago,
it made a ree-cord. I was there when that house was
built. It was twenty foot square. That and a few
furrows of plowed ground was all there was to the
county seat. We dedicated her with a barbecue; a barbecue
was the only thing Texas could afford then.
Huh! It’s the only thing she can afford now. We all
sot under a brush shed and everybody felt right good.
There was a barrel of whisky and a tin cup and a
nigger with a fiddle. That’s the way to start a county
seat right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There wasn’t a foot of railroad anywheres in them
days. Yet in Texas we’ve got over a hunderd miles of
railroad built already. The Lord knows what’ll happen
next.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You talking about shirts, Len! Enduring of the
war, three or four years ago, all my folks had to make
their own shirts. The women folks had to weave and
spin the woolsey. First thing I can remember was
helping to braid hide and horse-hair ropes. Everybody
tanned their own leather with oak bark. We made our
own saddle trees out of forks and rawhide, and we
covered them with our own leather—<span class='it'>lastro</span>, <span class='it'>rosaderos</span>,
taps and all. We didn’t have no wells; we drunk out’n
the creeks. Some neighbor had to make all the shoes we
got. We ground our corn meal in a hand mill and we
made our own wagons and ox yokes. If we got a loom
or spinning wheel we had to make that too. Folks
used to make hats out of palmetto; they braided them
theirselves. What we got done we had to do; there
wasn’t no one to hire nor nothing to pay them with.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shirt? Why a shirt, now, Len—a shirt in the old
times used to last a feller for years. Has yores?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It shore has,” replied Len Hersey. “She’s been a
plumb good one, too, and I’m sorry to see her go. My
mammy made her for me, I don’t know how long
back, but quite some time. Trouble about shirts is,
anyways boughten ones, it takes so much for spurs
and boots and saddles a feller ain’t got much left to
buy a shirt. I wouldn’t be no ways contented with one
of them homemade saddles of yourn no more. It
don’t leave much for shirts atter you got a cow outfit
paid fer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But as I was sayin’, I’m happy just to drift along
over this here country. Ain’t she fine? This morning,
along when the sun was shinin’ so perty, you’d orter seen
old Sanchez’ fighting rooster! He natural flewed up
on the cart and crowed to a fare ye well, he felt that
good!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’d ’a’ been a lot better off if he’d ’a’ sot on top
the cart every night,” commented Nabours. “Anita,
old Sanchez’ woman, she starts out with three roosters
and eight hens, allowing, I reckon, to start a hen ranch
somewhere up north in case we got busted and couldn’t
get home. She can’t no ways start one now. The
skunks and wildcats and coyotes has got ’em all excepting
old Mister Gallina, and he shy part of one
wing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ain’t that rooster like a fool Texan? He’s lonesome
and broke, and don’t know where he’s at, and part
of his comb is tore, and he can’t fly much; but, ‘Praise
God,’ says he, ‘I got both my spurs!’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shore he does,” nodded Len Hersey. “All the
whole state o’ Texas ever has owned has been a pair o’
spurs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Funny how time changes,” he went on, lolling on
his saddle horn as he spoke. “When my pap moved into
Ulvade County cows wasn’t worth nothing. The only
thing to do was to kill them for their hides, and if you
got four bits for a hide that was big money. Lately
people got a dollar apiece fer hides. I wouldn’t be
surprised ef we got two dollars a hide in Aberlene.
We’ll like enough have to sell ’em fer the hides. Ain’t
no money in cows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was on a herd oncet that driv to Shreveport time
of the war. We got into cockleburs so heavy the cows’
tails got like clubs. They’d hung up by the tails in
the piney woods over in Louisiana. You could hear
’em bawl bloody murder. I don’t know how many we
left hanging in the piney woods. There wasn’t no
money in that drive and the cows got thin as rails.
We couldn’t even skin ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huh!” commented the older man. “The longer
you live the nearer you’ll come to learning how many
things can happen to folks that trails cows, son. Give
us two or three more acts of God on this drive, and
we’ll be lucky ef we hit Aberlene with fifty head of
cows to skin. We-all may have to sell our saddles
to get home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I wouldn’t get no new shirt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ain’t promising you none.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Len Hersey philosophically, reaching in
a pocket for loose tobacco, “so long’s a man has got
his spurs he don’t need a thousand shirts nohow. I
don’t see nothing to worry about.”</p>

another, the Del Sol adventurers now were far
into their second month on the trail. The
summer was approaching, although they had as yet
made scarce more than three-fourths of their entire distance
to the railroad. Day after day they advanced
over a wholly unsettled country that lay for nearly its
entire length between the more settled civilized tribes
on the east and the buffalo range toward the west.
Clinging in their wavering line fairly close to the ninety-eighth
meridian, without a guide, watch, calendar or
compass, they now had reached a region beautiful as
a wilderness, but soon to be the seat of a later and undreamed
civilization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had been in wilderness practically all the way.
At that time Austin was little more than a straggling
country town. The herd cast dust into the one street of
Fort Worth, then boasting not over one hundred inhabitants;
and that was the last of the upper Texas
towns. But what a line of cities was to follow their
path on ninety-eight!</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Indian Nations they had crossed the Washita,
where now stands the thriving town of Chickasha,
Oklahoma. El Reno, of Oklahoma, was grassland
then, near the ford of the North Fork of the Canadian.
Kingfisher was not dreamed of on the trail from the
North Fork to the Cimarron; and beyond that the city
of Enid was to wait until long after cattle days were
gone and the cattle trail had moved itself much farther
to the west. Above them they aimed for Caldwell,
just across the Kansas line then but a ragged frontier
town. Thence the wagon tongue pointed toward
Wichita, when Wichita was hardly more than a furrow
in the ground, “a mile long and an inch wide.” A railroad
was still unforeseen in any of these vicinities in
1867; but railroads soon were to follow, almost in the
footsteps of the earliest herd to Abilene. So much,
to make understandable the exultation of these men as
they discovered for themselves a country, or a succession
of countries, absolutely virgin so far as the
white man was concerned; a pastoral empire that never
has had a parallel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whether by accident or design, the location of their
northbound path was a lucky or a shrewd one. Scarcely
anywhere else would there have been so few Indians
to disturb them, nor could their experience easily be
repeated. The depredations of the tribesmen, their
begging of the drovers, their demands of tribute of all
the northbound herds were still in the future, since
as yet the Indians had not learned of the northern
passing of the white men which was to come in a great
wave in the ensuing years; and since not many tribes
knew this herd was passing. The Del Sol men were
pioneers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How rich, how wildly alluring, this unsullied world
which now was all their own to enjoy! Their wild
cattle now advanced quite usually in sight of an almost
continuous spectacle of wild buffalo, wild horses, wild
deer. At times the herd had to be held while a body
of buffalo was parted by rifle fire to let them through.
There seemed no end to the animal life of the region
into which they came. It was all so different from
Texas now that they felt themselves strangers in a
foreign land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their next river was the Cimarron, one more stream
heading down from the high, dry buffalo plains of the
Panhandle to the sandy reaches and the flat loam lands
to the eastward. Making down out of the strip of
scrubby timber which they encountered below their
crossing, the herdsmen made short work of the Cimarron,
which was at so low a stage that the carts were
driven through and the cattle did not have to swim
at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their start had been approximately at the thirtieth
degree of latitude. They had now reached, just above
the Cimarron crossing, the parallel of thirty-six, which
later represented, as well as any arbitrary delineation,
the vague dividing line between the southern and the
northern ranges.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above them now by one degree of latitude lay the
south line of Kansas; between, the narrow unsettled
and unorganized east-and-west tract so long known
as the Cherokee Strip or the Cherokee Outlet. The
existence of this strip of land was proof that the
greatest range of the buffalo lay yet farther to the
west, in the short-grass land; for forty years before
this time the Cherokees had fought the Osages to
secure an outlet over their land to the buffalo range
beyond. But of all these things also the Del Sol men
were ignorant or careless. They did not know where
they were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roll along, little dogies, roll along! You broke one
of the greatest paths in all the world! You carried the
South into the North! It was you who ended the
war!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Roll along, little dogies, roll along!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lazy song of half-somnolent riders, ragged, lean,
brown, rose on the afternoon air of one more sunny
day after sunny day. By this time the herd had but
one more considerable stream, the Salt Fork of the
Arkansas, between it and the main stream of the Arkansas.
The men now all were studying geography
as best they might, for gradually they all had concluded
that Texas was far behind them, and that they were in
a world they knew not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s shore a perty country, Miss Taisie,” said
Jim Nabours when they paused for their noonday rest,
the first stop north of the Cimarron. “It looks to me
like folks could almost live here, some day, though I
don’t see no cows nowheres.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could not dream that within a few short years
there would be cattle under fence in all that country;
that long before that time abundant strays would run
wild as wild horses; that even then stretched illimitedly
the great upper range, wholly undiscovered, soon to
be clamoring for cows, to carry on a business which was
then an unsuspected thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come along here, Miss Taisie,” he continued, inviting
her to take a seat beside him on the grass and
spreading down a crumpled sheet of brown paper. It
held what cannot be bought to-day for any money—a
more or less precise map of the first old cow trail
from Texas north, although only his rude amateur hand
had drawn it. The clumsy finger of the trail boss
pointed out to his employer their locality as near as he
himself could guess it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dan McMasters and me talked this over afore he
quit us,” he explained. “I’ve drawed it the best I could,
and it’s sort of helpful too. Near as I can figure it,
we’re just about to cross thirty-six north. My pap told
me that thirty-six-thirty was where slavery ended and
the damn Yankees begun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; the Missouri Compromise,” nodded Taisie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anyways my pap told me that thirty-six, along
in there, was about where cotton wouldn’t grow so well
nohow, and where the ticks probably would fall offen
the cows in the wintertime. The line must come right
about here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What line?” demanded Len Hersey, who was listening
in and who now bent over the rude map curiously.
“I kep’ a clost look all the time we’ve been on the
trail, an’ so fur from seein’ any thirty-six lines atween
here and where we all started, I ain’t seen nary line
a-tall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They ain’t marked on the ground, man,” replied his
leader gently; “it’s only on the paper. But what can
I expect of a boy raised on squirrel and corn pone,
like you was? Yes, sir; thirty-six is just in and around
right here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made on this soiled paper a little cross, using a
gnawed stub of a pencil which in its time had tallied
perhaps a hundred thousand cows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There ain’t no moss on the trees no more,” mused
Len. “The grass ain’t the same here. My law! did
you ever see so many greenhead flies in your borned
days as we’ve had all the way from the Red River
north? And as for mosquitoes, Miss Lockhart,” he
added, “a feller don’t darst get his arms out of his
blankets at night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked ruefully at his elbows, entirely visible
through the sleeves of his only shirt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like enough a man could make some corn up here,”
mused Jim Nabours, sagely, looking around him over
the rolling prairie. “He couldn’t raise no cows; it’d
be too cold. No, nor of course he couldn’t raise no
cotton. Well it’s a right purty country; but can’t
never be settled, even if the Osages was gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder how big a place is Aberlene, anyhow,”
queried the ragged cowhand. “Me, I never seen a railroad.
Down at Fort Worth several men been saying
there’d be a railroad there some time. That’s all
foolishness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shore it is,” said Nabours. “Well, we got no
railroad here neither. Let’s move along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were now, although they were not aware of it,
to pass up the course of Turkey Creek towards the Salt
Fork for two days’ march above the Cimarron. When
they came to the heads of that stream and of Mulberry
Creek, which ran thence southeast—also a stream
unknown to any map at that time—they reached a
pleasant rolling plain where it seemed as though the
entire country was alive with moving game. It was a
spectacle which awakened even their blasé souls, used to
wild game all their lives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Northward appeared a vast herd of buffalo, usually
a most welcome sight to the plains traveler, but one
always dreaded by the drover, who sometimes had to
start a road through them at cost of much ammunition.
Antelope, wild horses, all the great game of the unfrequented
plains were visible also. But all this game
was on the move and not feeding peacefully, as naturally
it should be. Why was this?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours came back as soon as he sensed the nature
of what lay ahead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Throw ’em off, boys!” he called hurriedly. “Hold
’em in here and don’t go a foot further, or we’ll lose
every hoof we’ve got. That country’s full of buffalo
and everything else, and something has set them going.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leaving his best men to keep the cattle under control,
he took with him two or three men and rode rapidly on
ahead. They pulled up at a little eminence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great Snakes!” said one of the men. “Just look
there!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The entire country was dotted with scattered black
masses of moving buffalo. The numbers seemed endless,
uncountable. Something had pushed them east of
the more abundant short-grass range far to the westward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll have to break that up or we’ll never get
through,” said Nabours. “Yet I was thinking this
country up here wouldn’t feed cows! Just look at the
game!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They could see also band after band of wild horses,
magnificent animals with high heads and heavy manes
and tails; creatures that never failed to awaken keen
enthusiasm among even the most experienced plainsman.
Now, also, they were in an elk country, and
herds of these creatures trotted off, following the same
general drift to the east and south. There was such
an immeasurably vast blending of wild life as not any
one of these men ever expected to see again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look! Look, men!” called Nabours, who was
studying the sight eagerly. “If that ain’t cows I’m
a liar!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was entirely right. Caught in the general drift,
there were two or three score of domestic cattle, of no
man might tell what origin; no doubt outcasts or strays
of some Osage Indian settlement to the east. The
sight of these especially caused the blood of the range
men to leap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t tell me this ain’t a good country!” exclaimed
Nabours. “Them’s cows!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve got right funny horns,” said Lem Hersey
critically; and forsooth these cattle, descendants of
some Eastern stock, even then lacked the wide horns
of the old Texan breed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ain’t particular about their horns,” remarked
Nabours. “They got hide enough to hold the Fishhook
brand, and they look like strays to me. Any of
’em comes around here too clost I ain’t going to let
his horns stand in the way. We need some more strays.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But ef once our herd gets in there they’ll be strays
too. We’ve got to hold ’em back, boys, and wait till
this thing gets by. This is a general movement of the
range stuff, plumb out of the country, and if our
cows begin to drift with this it’ll be worse than anything
we’ve run into yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hark!” A man threw up his hand. “What’s
that? Shooting on ahead?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They sat their horses, uncertain. The sound of rifle
fire in their experience was usually a signal of danger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait! Wait, men!” Nabours in turn raised a
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sound of rifle fire was unmistakable. The
heavy reports were borne by the prairie winds across
what might be a mile of open space. The detonations
were spaced almost mathematically alike.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s not Injuns!” exclaimed Jim Nabours. “That’s
a white man! He’s got a stand on a bunch of buffalo:
I’ll bet a horse that’s what it is.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='298' id='Page_298'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXXIV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE TRAIL MAKER</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>T</span></span>HE reports came steadily—ten, fifteen, twenty.
It was easy for the trail men to locate the rifleman.
They advanced rapidly in his direction.
As they topped a little ridge there lay before them the
last scene of one of countless similar tragedies of the
Plains then going on all over the country a thousand
by fifteen hundred miles in extent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within the circle of a shallow swale stood a huddled
group of black figures of buffalo still on their feet.
Among them, around them, over a space no larger than
a half acre, lay motionless or struggling two score other
dark figures—the bodies of the fallen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The drovers saw the rifle smoke, two hundred yards
from the game. The killer lay concealed back of a
wisp of grass which topped a near-by ridge. He lay
flat, his heavy rifle supported by two cross sticks, his
wiping rod and another hickory wand held together by
the fingers of his left hand as a rest for the barrel.
His hat was off. His hair tossed, blending with the
waving grasses. He never had shown himself at all.
Mercilessly, carefully, he placed one shot after another.
At each shot a dust spot spurted out on a dark hide.
An animal staggered, made a little run; but, shot
through the lungs, soon lay down. The survivors
smelled at it, made short rushes, returned, stood confused.
Each time one of the victims headed out, it
fell before the white puff of smoke which came from
the hidden death engine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The killer had the range perfectly. He paid no attention
to the result of any shot, for he knew that it
was fatal. Each heavy bullet tore through the lungs
of a buffalo. It would not go far. The ground was
black with them already. Some day the bone pickers
would rejoice, for here they would find fifty skeletons
packed close together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the “stand” of the professional or the expert
buffalo hunter. The skin hunters were even then pushing
out into the Plains on their unholy calling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the skin hunter did not belong to the Indian
lands, and no Indian hunted buffalo in this way. The
Del Sol men therefore were not sure as to the identity
of this man. They rode off to investigate, not showing
themselves at first. But at length they did sharpen on
the sky line. The staggered remnant of the befuddled
animals caught their scent in the air and at last nerved
themselves for a saving rush away from this slaughter
hole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he saw the intruders the rifleman himself drew
back to safety. After a short mutual reconnaissance he
rose and held up his hand in the sign of peace. The
Del Sol men approached in like fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The marksman might now be seen to be a man of
anywhere from forty to sixty years of age, wrinkled of
face, crowned with stubbly hair. His dark, thick skin
showed him to be of mixed blood. His garb was that
of the white man, save that he wore no hat. He leaned
on his deadly rifle with unconcern and in silence as
the trail men approached.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How, friend!” saluted Nabours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you do?” replied the other in fair English.
“Which way you go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“North. We’ve got a herd of cows, three thousand
head, five miles south of here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three thousand head! Ha! You go Ab’lene—Caldwell—Wich’ta?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, if we can ever get through here. I was wondering
what had drifted the buffalo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I kill ’em few for hides,” grinned the half-breed.
“My man come pretty soon for skin. My camp over,
there, maybe so two mile. Where you come from?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Caldwell County,” answered Nabours. “Our brand
is T. L. You’re headed south? Are you buffalo
hunting?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, got wagon train—Army supplies. Take ’em
south from railroad across Nations, for Caddoes,
Wichitas, Wacos. I just laying out road for wagons.
Army forts got to have supplies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, the country needs a road all right,” commented
Nabours. “We started to find what they call
the Chisholm Trail. There ain’t no such a thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No?” The oldish face wrinkled into a smile. “No
find ’em trail? Too bad! You don’t know me,” he
added after a time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, we don’t know nobody.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m Jesse Chisholm. My ranch is in Nations, south
long way. I bring plenty horses up from Texas. I
know your people. I been all across Texas from Palo
Pinto to Double Mountain Fork, Buffalo Gap, Estacado;
all the time I make trails.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you have left one behind you now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure! She’s easy from here to Caldwell. I got
fifty wagon, plenty horse, plenty mule; make ford,
sometime make bridge, sometime make raft. I got
some wagons for Colonel Griswold. He’s going to
make big reservation for Kiowas and Comanches. Fort
Sill, he’ll call ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you’re Jesse Chisholm?” remarked Jim Nabours
after a time. “I didn’t know for sure there was no
such person. Tell me, is there such a place as Aberlene?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure! I trail up Arkansas River from east, pass
Wichita. I hear Ab-lene up north. Sure!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the Injuns know Jesse Chisholm,” he continued.
“Osage, Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw—I trade ’em
horse all through there. I know Shawnee Trail, through
Choctaws.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then tell us, friend, since you know this country
pretty well, how far is it out of the Nations from here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe so fifty-six mile. Caldwell, he’s on line
above Osages. Always grass. So you go Ab’lene?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We don’t know where it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You come my camp with me. I got a man in my
camp, he come from Ab’lene. He come down here to
find you people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Find us? He never heard of us!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dunno. He say he come south till he meets cows.
He show you Ab’lene all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Len, ride back to the men and tell them to hold the
herd till I come,” said Nabours, turning. “I may be
late. I’ll go over and see what there is in all this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without further speech, the famous half-breed trail
maker led them back for a quarter of a mile or so to
where he had picketed his horse. Soon they passed
another uncommunicative half-breed, driving a wagon
team. A few words between him and Chisholm, and
the driver passed on to begin his share of the work—skinning
the dead buffalo, for their hides alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In time they found the wagon encampment, its band
of horses and mules hobbled or picketed near by; a
pleasant though extraordinary sight in these surroundings.
Chisholm led the way to a point a few yards
distant from the main camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lying on his saddle blankets under the shade of a
scrubby bush, there was a white man—a bearded man
of middle age, with clothing not much worn and of
distinctly Northern cut. Caught by a severe attack of
fever and ague, he now was in a raging fever. But
at the sight of these newcomers—who presentiment
told him were the very men he sought—he sprang to
his feet and held out his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew you’d come!” said he. “I know you are
drovers! Where is your herd? I told them I’d find
a herd coming up to Abilene this spring. McCoyne’s
my name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said the trail boss, “they call me Jim
Nabours. We’re people from Caldwell County, Texas—thousand
miles south of here for all I know, or
anyway six hundred. We’re in the T. L.; Fishhook
road brand. We was headed for Aberlene.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s my town,” said the stranger. “And I’ll
tell you, friend, she is a town! We’ve got the railroad,
and I’ve got the stockyards, built and waiting. Don’t
let no one talk to you about Baxter Springs; don’t you
think of stopping at Caldwell or Wichita. Abilene is
the only town in Kansas with a railroad and a stockyards
and a real market. There’s buyers five deep
a-waiting for you up there. How many cattle you got?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say three thousand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great Scott! Abilene’s made! You’re made too!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How much did you pay for cows when you started
north?” he asked. Nabours was looking at his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ain’t so sick!” said he. “Well, we didn’t pay
nothing for ours. We raised them by hand from
calves. How much can a man get for fine fours in
your neighborhood?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that depends; but all they’re worth. Do you
want to contract yours as they come, straight fours
at ten a head?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ten a head!” said Jim Nabours with well-feigned
surprise. “What? Fours like them? Fat and ready
for market? Well there may be a little she-stuff in here
and there, but we couldn’t help that. Us Texans always
figgers one cow’s as old and as fat as another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As good as any,” asserted the stranger. “There’s
millions of acres of range north and west of Abilene,
a-weeping and a-wailing for stock cattle. There’s
millions of pounds of beef that’s got to be raised on
Army contracts to feed the reservation Indians. There’s
all America and all Europe east of here. Market?
Why, man, we can take five million cattle, in five years,
if you can bring them in! You’re the first, and you
didn’t know it! You didn’t even know where Abilene
was!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We don’t yet,” replied Nabours; “but we’re willing
to rock along with you and have you show us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be glad to! What d’you say to three cents a
pound on the hoof?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours looked at him with astonishment in his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mister, you talk like them cows was sugar or coffee.
I never did hear of ary man selling a cow that way. No
man can tell how much a cow weighs by looking at him,
and I never did see one weighed. Of course, I could
make a scales by swinging a pole and putting a few
men at the other end of it to balance up a cow—you
can guess how much a man weighs pretty clost. But
all that’d take too much time. No, a cow is a cow where
I come from, whether he’s big or little.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what d’you say to eleven dollars a head?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t say nothing. These here cows is family
pets, and we don’t like fer to part with them. But like
enough this is the only herd that ever will come up
from Texas, anyhow this year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wouldn’t say twelve dollars?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Straight count, a cow for a cow, as she tallies out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’d sorter like to see the herd first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It ain’t no trade,” said Nabours calmly. “If I’d
sell them family favorites of ours the owner of Del Sol
would feel sore—she shore would.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You say ’she’ would. Are you working for a
widow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She ain’t a widow yet, but she may be a’fore
long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Married?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The same answer. Not yet, but right apt to be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How old is she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I don’t know. Plenty of cows we got in
that herd is a heap older than she is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you’re taking a girl through to Abilene!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s wrong with Aberlene, friend?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” admitted McCoyne, “we got eight saloons
and five gambling palaces now; a good many railroad
men and skin hunters and people like that hang around.
It might be a little bit swift if you ain’t used to traveling
fast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What you say sounds cheerful. We’d like to wet
the dust in our throats and play a few cards in a
innocent way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t say that Abilene ain’t safe,” argued the
market man. “We got the best town marshal in
Kansas, or are going to have if we can get him away
from Hays City. Wild Bill Hickok is his name. He’s
the best shot in Kansas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He may be in Kansas, but he ain’t in Texas,”
replied Nabours. “We had him along ourselves. You
didn’t happen to meet up with a man named Dan
McMasters in Caldwell, did you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McCoyne drew himself up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t go to Caldwell. But since you mention it,
that name sounds familiar. I met a McMasters over in
the Baxter Springs country last winter; tall fellow, with
a little mustache. He was the man that told me he
was going to send up a Texas herd when he got back
home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He done so,” replied Nabours. “Here it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He certainly done us both a good turn. I was saying
McCoyne—Joe McCoyne’s my name. I come from
Indianny. I’m president of the stockyards up to
Abilene. The whole Eastern country is out here hunting
cattle. There’s a thousand miles of range north
and west of us that’s got to have cattle. Why, cattle
will be gobbled up as fast as you can drive them in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must be running a kind of cow heaven, friend,”
said Jim Nabours. “Well, come and see our boss.
You needn’t be scared, even if she ain’t married. I
will pertect you against any designing female that might
be smit by your looks.”</p>

turned back to bid a temporary farewell to
Jesse Chisholm and his wagon train, departing
thereafter for the herd, which had been held some
miles below. The Eastern man sat his horse somewhat
strangely to the eyes of the Texans; but no matter
what the speed, he ceased not joltingly to sound the
praises of his community.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Every time he come down in the saddle he says,
‘Aberlene! Aberlene! Kerchunk! Aberlene!’ ” explained
Len Hersey to his fellows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they came into view of the great herd, held
closely by the riders, Nabours pulled up with the
enthusiasm of the natural drover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look at ’em!” he exclaimed, waving a hand. “If
that ain’t a perty sight I don’t know what is!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great glory!” exclaimed the Abilene man. “I
didn’t know there were that many cattle in the world!
Sir, my fortune is made! Where’d you get them
all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In Texas we don’t ast no man that. I told you
we done raise them cows by hand, every one of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Abilene man gave a deep sigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t know what that means!” said he. “The
first herd up from Texas!” He babbled, speaking of
revolutions, epochs, swift changes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One by one he met the wild crew of the Del Sol
men, who wore a garb and spoke a language unfamiliar
to himself. Praying for trail herds from the South, the
Northern men never really visualized the new personnel
which was pushing north from the lower range. Indeed
at that time of the American civilization there had
been but little actual interchange of population between
the North and the South. The natural expansion of
the republic had been westward. As to the old cruel
line of Mason and Dixon, it never fully was broken
down by the Civil war. But here was the first break—the
penetration of a peaceful, natural commerce, here
on the Western plains. Through that opening, in the
years immediately to come, flowed values greater than
those of barter and trade in horned kine. A manly
understanding passed back and forth, and out of that a
tacit union, a concord in all young strong impulses.
That union of North and South built the West overnight.
The world has never seen a better country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That empire gave us our first and only true American
tradition—the tradition of the West. Great as that
American tradition is, grotesque as we have rendered
it, far as we have carried from dignity and truth the
tradition of the West, “the Range” still is a word to
conjure with to-day, and will be to-morrow. Here,
then, was the very beginning of that great tradition.
It was no more than a generation ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My Lord!” repeated the Northern man. “Just look
at them! I guess that’s all the cattle in the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t reckon so,” replied Nabours. “We got
sever’l left down in Texas. Come along; you must
meet the owner of them all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They approached Taisie Lockhart’s camp where the
giant carts—things of wonder to the stockyards man—stood
gaunt and grim in the twilight. Taisie was
superintending the preparation of the evening meal, her
women busy at the fire. At first the Northern man
took her to be one of the young riders of the herd.
She stood straight and free of self-consciousness as any
of the men; as brown of face and hand, much like
them in apparel. She wore the universal checked
trousers, stuffed into her boots. But the boots apparently
had been made by loving hands, so neat were
they, so sewed with countless little seams. And at
their tops, in red, was the Lone Star of Texas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taisie’s cotton shirt, a man’s shirt, was open at the
neck. Above the high-water mark of the ardent sun,
protected by her hat brim, flowed back the mass of her
bright hair, which for sake of comfort she wore now,
as customarily, in a great queue wrapped with thong,
as though she were some Indian woman. True, she
might have been the forerunning arbiter of woman’s
ways of costume fifty years later in the West; but
Taisie Lockhart’s dress was not done in any imitation
or any affectation. She had chosen it for two reasons—firstly,
because she was broke; secondly, because it
was convenient.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Lockhart,” remarked Jim Nabours in the
formula which he best knew, “shake hands with Mr. ——.
What did you tell me your name was?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“McCoyne—Joe McCoyne, of Abilene, ma’am. I’m
pleased to meet you.” Which also was in conformance
with ineradicable formula.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taisie held out her hand in silence, with her usual
straight glance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You didn’t expect to see me down here from
Abilene, did you, Miss Lockhart?” began the stockyards
man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, no sir; are we almost there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right there. It ain’t much over two hundred
mile. I knew there’d be a herd up this year. I was
telling your foreman that I met a Mr. McMasters,
Daniel McMasters, a while back, over around Baxter
Springs. He said he was going down to Central Texas.
You don’t happen to know him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The swift blood surged up to Taisie’s forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, yes; he rode with us for a time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Northern man was all for business. He
cleared his throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Lockhart,” said he, “I’ve been offering your
man twelve dollars a head straight through. I’d contract
for them at that right here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taisie Lockhart gave a sudden gasp. Twelve dollars
a head meant riches! But she turned toward her
trail boss, who had emitted an ominous cough, audible a
quarter of a mile, and began now to wink so portentously
that even the blind must have given him attention.
She hesitated, her eyes dubious. The stranger laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see you’ve got to talk it over together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But his zeal for Abilene overcame even his own
disposition to do a turn in personal trade. Besides, the
personality of this young woman produced its usual
effect, on him as on most men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to buy your cattle, Miss Lockhart,” said
he, “and maybe I will; but let’s not talk price any more
down here. This is the first herd to come to Abilene,
and I’m going to see that you get the best price possible,
so when you carry the news back to Texas that’ll
bring more herds up next year. I don’t want to rob
as young and fine-looking a woman as you are; and
besides that, the first one to come up the trail.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the last!” said Jim Nabours conclusively. “You
don’t know what I’ve been through!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stranger smiled humorously, his eyes once
more turning to the young girl, of unmistakably gentle
breeding. “In a way, you don’t belong here,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come an’ git it!” came the supper call of Buck,
the negro cook, now rising at his fireside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men not engaged on the herd straggled in toward
the fire. The distant crooning of the hands at the
bed ground came through the twilight. The stockman
threw back his shoulders, drew a deep breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I been having a little fever and ague, ma’am,”
said he; “but come to think of it, it’s quit. I’d rather
be here than any place else in the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have quinine,” said Taisie Lockhart, “and
coffee and boiled beef, and some very good bread that
Milly has made. Won’t you please sit down with us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all sat upon the ground around the little fire,
children, contented. The world still was young.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='312' id='Page_312'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXXVI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>ROLL ALONG, LITTLE DOGIES!</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>L</span></span>ATE at night the leaders of the herd sat talking,
but the start on the next day was early. The
country ahead was now open and free of buffalo.
Once more the great herd trailed out. They left the
camp of Jesse Chisholm with his wagon train a little
at one side, but the leaders rode over to say farewell to
the taciturn old half-breed. McCoyne promised him
many things if he would load his next cargo at Abilene
instead of Wichita. And so they parted, as ships
sailing seas but little known.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thence on there was no need for the wagon tongue
or the North Star. One Chisholm Trail, of many mythical
ones, was now really begun. The marks of the
wagon wheels were unmistakable. The giant steers of
the Del Sol vanguard swung out along the main traveled
road as though this was what they long had sought.
McCoyne expressed wonderment at seeing so few men
handle thousands of great animals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve been doing ten or twelve miles a day?”
said he. “We can make fifteen or twenty. Push
them along. All Abilene is waiting for them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was plain sailing and the weather was good. No
tribute-seeking Indians appeared, and the cattle were
as peaceable as though they never had dreamed of a
run. The Del Sol outfit put mile after mile behind
it, rapidly, steadily, the work oxen on the carts sometimes
almost on a trot, the sore backs exempt in the
remuda, every man feeling that trail’s end was not
so far.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Between them and the Arkansas River now ran only
one considerable stream—the Salt Fork, spoken of with
respect by drovers, for quite customarily it offered
swimming water. But now, even if the advanced season
had not left the water low, the Salt Fork would
have been by no means an insuperable obstacle, for
Jesse Chisholm had left here a good raft which he
had built for his own purposes. It was better than a
bridge. The cattle swam the stream readily, confidently,
and in brief order the carts were jerked across
at the ends of spliced reatas. The entire crossing went
forward methodically and without the loss of a single
head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So that’s the way you do it?” commented the man of
Abilene. “You had some rivers below here too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Almost. This here is play compared to it,” said
Nabours. “But you can go anywheres with cows if
you know how. That’s the only thing us Texans does
know. Yes, we got sever’l cows down in Texas. And
I don’t see why this country here wouldn’t raise cows—in
the summer anyhow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They advanced through the Osage country, over
as beautiful grassland as a man ever saw, the prairie
covering wavering knee-deep and spotted with many
flowers. Wild game was in sight much of the time.
There was not a weed. No plow had been here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Roll along, little dogies!” came the lazy voice of a
swing man. “Roll along, roll along!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fifty miles more of happy, lazy, carefree loafing
along the trail, and they left the straggling village of
Caldwell on the right, just at the Kansas line. Nabours
would not let his men go into town, but headed twenty
miles to the westward across the grasslands of lower
Kansas, making for the crossing of the Arkansas which
Chisholm had established with his wagons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Heretofore the advance had been happily and singularly
free from annoyance at the hands of the Indian
tribes whose great domain had been crossed. When
well over the Kansas line, however, they were caught
up by a little band of Osages who had followed along
their trail, ignoring reservation limits for reasons of
their own. In stature they were gigantic men, their
heads partly shaved, leaving a high roach of dense, stiff
hair after the traditional Osage custom. They were
painted bravely enough in red and ocher, and all were
armed with fine buffalo bows of <span class='it'>bois d’arc</span>. Their leader
and his band seemed friendly enough and disposed to
parley. Not caring for such hangers-on, Nabours and
a few other men stopped for a conference. The chief
began with a request soon to become usual along
the trail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You got plenty wohaw,” he began. “This Injun
country. You give wohaw.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He held up all the fingers of his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give you ten cows?” exclaimed Jim Nabours. “I
ain’t give a cow to nobody all the way up the trail,
and I won’t give one to you. You go on back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good Injun!” said the leader of the Osages. He
handed out a folded piece of paper. “Caldwell. Him
send.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a message bearer. Nabours took the letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, this is from Dan McMasters!” said he.
“Five days ago he was in Caldwell. Says he has gone
on now to Wichita,” explaining to McCoyne and the
others. “He may be at Aberlene by the time we get
there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, you, here!” he remarked to the chief. “We’ll
give you one wohaw. You set down and wait a while.
We’ll ride on up to the wohaws.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said the Osage partisan in good humor.
“Him say you give wohaw. We bring you paper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They disposed themselves on the grass, their bows
unstrung.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You seem to be all the time hearing from this man
McMasters,” said McCoyne. “How come he’s on
ahead of you so far?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a long story,” said Jim Nabours. “He did
ride with us for a while.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew that man over at Baxter and on the Missouri
border,” ruminated the man from Abilene. “Quiet
sort of fellow—mysterious—never did say much. I
was figuring on a market over there for Texas cattle.
But I learned about a gang of raiders in there that had
been cutting every herd that came up from Texas bound
for Missouri or Iowa or Illinois. Those border ruffians
killed probably a dozen men altogether. They tied up
and whipped maybe a dozen more. They terrorized
every trail outfit that came through there, and the
natural result was that they kept off St. Louis from
ever becoming a real cow town. Nothing could get
through. A little thing sometimes makes a heap of
difference later on in big things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The leader of that gang was a ruffian by name of
Rudabaugh,” he added. “The Missourians finally run
him south.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Nabours quietly. “The Texans have
finally run him north again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And this man McMasters was after him?”
McCoyne turned suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He might be. He is now. He’s been keeping ahead
of us, and that’s the reason.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He now explained at length the machinations of the
trail pirates and the untimely end of them in the night
battle on the Washita.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He mostly plays a lone hand,” Nabours concluded.
“He’s an officer in the Rangers. That’s putting law
into Texas—the Rangers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we’ve only got one man to put law into
Abilene. I’m going to hire Wild Bill Hickok for our
town marshal. Wild Bill has got these bad people
buffaloed. Counting in his work as a Union sharpshooter,
under Curtis, in the Missouri country, he’d
have to have a long gun stock to carry all his notches.
It’s sure he’s killed somewhere between seventy-five
and a hundred men. In 1860, when he was taking
care of the stage stock over in east of Abilene, he was
jumped by McCandless and his gang—ten men there
were in all. You’ve heard of that fight? They were
going to run off the stage stock for the Confederate
Army. They tackled Bill in his shack, ten of them, and
he was alone. He killed nine out of the ten by himself.
Not so bad, eh? I don’t know as I ever knew Bill
to serve a warrant or make an arrest. But I’ll bet
one thing—if we get him for town marshal, Abilene
will be first in graveyards, the same as she is first
in everything else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It shore looks like Dan McMasters has a pleasant
time a-waiting for him,” commented Nabours. “But
he’s usual able to take care of hisself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, I’ll have to cut out a beef for these yellow-bellied
friends of ours,” he added. “We’ve picked up
a shorthorn stray or so a couple of days ago, and put
a Fishhook on him to keep him from catching cold.
Like enough it was a Osage steer, anyhow, so I reckon
I’ll let ’em have that one. Go cut it out, Len, when we
come up with the herd.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Osages and all, they rode along. Easily, lazily, as
though he knew precisely where the animal was, Len
Hersey found it, rode it out of the herd and drove it
back close to the Indian group.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s your wohaw,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Osage chieftain smiled amiably. A bow
twanged. In five minutes the ribs of the beef were
broiling on a prairie Osage fire. The dust of the great
herd of spotted cattle was lessening to the north.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='318' id='Page_318'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXXVII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>ABILENE</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>I</span></span>N THE front room of a raw board building, on
which carpenters still were laboring noisily, sat
a tall man at a table, pleasantly humming a tune
to himself as he bent over his task.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In appearance he was a Viking; a very strong man,
bulky, above six feet in height, and yet lithe, easy,
graceful, with perfect coördination of physical faculties.
His eye was very blue. His yellow hair was long,
like that of ancient warriors; so long that it fell in
ripples on his shoulders; and, as hair of any warrior
should be, it was admirably kept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The garb of this striking-looking man—one of the
handsomest men that ever crossed the Missouri in
the days of the frontier, which is much to say of males—was
on the whole devoid of pretentiousness. His
dark clothing was ready-made, but his boots never
were ready-made. He showed the influence of the
South, where a man may be slouchy in all things save
as to his feet. This man’s boots were of fine calf,
closely cut to cover a small foot. A pair of gloves
lay on the table, the best of buckskin. His hat, of
the finest felt, was wide of brim and low of crown—the
hat of the upper range, distinct from the steeple-crown
Mexican sombrero.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had the entire border been combed, a finer example
of the better type of border man could not at that
time have been found than this one. In any corner
of the world his appearance would have called attention.
Two or three men sitting across from him against the
wall in the hotel office—for this building was no less
than the Drovers’ Cottage of Abilene, soon to be
famous across the Western world—eyed him with
silent respect as he sat busy, humming his carefree
melody. They very well knew Wild Bill Hickok,
whom rumor reported to be sought for as the new
town marshal of Abilene, first of the cow camps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The famous marshal of Hays City—as he then was—now
was engaged in the daily task which he never
neglected and never gave to hands other than his own—that
of cleaning his two heavy revolvers. No hand
but his ever had been allowed to touch one of these
weapons, even in the slightest or most friendly way.
He himself never failed to examine them every
morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were very long-barreled revolvers, and their
owner’s artistic fancy was indulged in them to the
extent of ivory handles. The metal work was dark.
The front sight on each had been filed down low. That
was just before the day of fixed ammunition, and
all revolvers still were muzzle-loaders as to the cylinders.
Under the barrel of each piece worked a
hinged ramrod, and the backs of the cylinders were
indented and tubed to permit admission of the percussion
caps. They handled a large round ball. Some
of these, with the small flask of fine rifle powder, lay
on the table near at hand. With a short, well-polished
round stick of hickory, Mr. Hickok was now engaged
in cleaning barrel and cylinder so thoroughly that
not a speck of dust remained. His boots and gloves
were clean; his shirt was clean; his face and hands
were clean; and, be sure, his guns were clean.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He finished his task at length, replaced each cylinder
and pushed down the pin on which it revolved. Then,
with eyes narrowing and lips pursed, he poured into
each cylinder barrel an exact—very exact—charge of
the fine powder, gently jolting each charge home,
and on top, with the utmost care, seating the round
ball and pushing it home with the hinged ramrod. Each
load was precisely like every other load. Then he
capped each nipple of the cylinder, held back each
hammer and rolled the cylinder with ear intent to
see that the click of the lock came absolutely even.
After this he slipped the long weapons into the greased
holsters at his heavy belt. His coat tails unobtrusively
covered the equipment. He walked to the new washbasin
at the new sink, cleansed and wiped his hands
on a towel not absolutely new; and so was ready for the
duties of the day, whatever these might be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Bill, going to get somebody to-day?” one
of the loafing skin hunters against the wall guffawed,
trying to be offhand, friendly and humorous. The
tall man looked at him steadily, his own face absolutely
emotionless, and made no reply at all. His dignity
was that of a lion among small animals. He was a
man of few confidences and no familiarities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Wild Bill Hickok stepped out into the street
he saw coming across the railroad track a stranger,
a young man tall as himself, though not so heavy of
build. The newcomer was clad much like himself,
in dark clothing, with neat boots. His coat swung
easily free, but to the specialized eye of Wild Bill it
covered something on either side. Moreover, he
presently noted that the young man wore his guns in
an odd way—the right-hand stock pointing back, the
left-hand one pointing forward. This peculiarity he
had never seen in the equipment of any man, cowman,
gambler or professional bad man. He asked himself,
if this man should happen to be left-handed, or if
he were a two-handed man, which gun would be used
first? That constituted, as Wild Bill admitted then
and there, a sort of mental problem which it might
take the thousandth of a second to decide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no pretentiousness about the newcomer,
more than there was about Wild Bill Hickok. They
both were simple, quiet men, low of voice, pleasant of
address. Two more typical killers did not then stand
west of the Missouri stream, although they were from
widely separated countries. The range, north and
south, upper and lower, ran well-nigh two thousand
miles in its longer dimension, and covered wide variations
in all types.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg your pardon, sir,” said the young man,
advancing. “I know this is Marshal Hickok. I am
McMasters, sheriff of Gonzales County, down in
Texas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The blue-eyed man put out his hand readily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know about you,” said he. “You are in the
Rangers, too, down there. That’s a good body of
men. I reckon they need to be good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s a lovely morning,” he continued. “I’ve
not had a drink yet this morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They walked down the ragged street, if street it
could be called, passing over the railroad track, whose
rails as yet hardly had been burnished by any wheels;
a track which ran but a few hours’ journey west of
Abilene at that time. There was a switch which would
accommodate perhaps twenty cars, some pens which
would hold perhaps five hundred head of cattle, some
chutes which never yet had been used. Like all the
rest of Abilene, the yards presented an aspect of raw
newness. The residential portion of the city consisted
largely of sod houses, dugouts and canvas tents,
although it did not lack unpainted pine in its more ambitious
structures. The broken expanse of high-fronted
wooden buildings along its single main street offered
the appearance conventional in the new railroad town
of the frontier of the West. There was a Golden
Eagle Clothing Store; two or three offering general
merchandise. There was no drug store, but there
were two barber shops and the Twin Livery Barn.
There was no church or school. But, as the apostle of
Abilene had said, there were many saloons and free
dance-halls, each in its way openly advertising its wares.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toward the saloon of his choice—which also apparently
offered dance-hall accommodations at seasonable
hours—Wild Bill bent his steps. The interior still
presented a certain dishabille. A sleepy negro was
sweeping out the corks. A barrel in a corner held
empty bottles in careless profusion. The chairs
presented an order apparently not preconcerted, and
the legs of some were broken. There was no billiard
table in all Abilene, and mahogany was not yet known
in any bar of Abilene. None the less, here was a
goodly plank, and back of it were arranged shelves still
holding bottles of liquid contents in spite of the late
obvious demand. The interior was not, to any imagination,
howso violent, a lovely thing to see in the
ghastly light of day. The light now was rather dim.
Two or three kerosene lamps still were burning, yellow
and sickly, not devoid of fumes, which joined the other
fumes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I usually come here for my liquor,” said Wild
Bill, “because I know Henry Doak has a barrel of
real bourbon, besides what he sells. It ain’t poison.
I never go against the liquor game very hard myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t best,” said McMasters. “Still, the oldest
man I ever knew told me he’d lived so long because
every morning before breakfast he took two or three
fingers of bourbon—when he could get it—and rubbed
his chest with a fresh corncob.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As good a way as any,” said Hickok. “A man
never dies till his time comes—and then he does.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was humming to himself as he searched for the
bottle which suited him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No three or four fingers for me,” said he. “Too
much, especially if you have got anything particular
to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A short gray man with white mustache and goatee
shuffled in, not vouchsafing any speech at all. He
brought them glasses and motioned Bill to a quiet
corner of the room, where at the hour they found themselves
quite alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Mr. McMasters,” said Bill, “I am glad to
see you in Abilene, and I wish you were going to live
here. It’s not just the healthiest place for a peace
officer. It maybe won’t be any healthier if the Texas
herds ever do begin to come in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know of one on the way,” said McMasters. “It
will be in now almost any day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hickok nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They used to drive up the Neosho in towards
Sedalia, a few years ago. Those toughs in there used
the trail men mighty rough. Dougherty, Ellison,
Hunter, McMasters, Lockhart—they were all good
men that tried to drive in there from Texas. It would
have paid St. Louis to have sent her whole police
force down there and cleaned up that gang of cattle
bandits. They’ve just headed off all the Texas cattle
that came up that way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know about that pretty well,” assented Dan
McMasters. “You say McMasters. Calvin McMasters
was my father. They killed him. He was a friend
of Colonel Burleson Lockhart. They killed Lockhart
too. I’ve been in there since, once or twice, on business
of my own. That gang were very largely friends of
Dave Tutt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their eyes met silently. Dave Tutt was a man whom
Wild Bill Hickok killed in a street duel on the public
square of Springfield, Missouri, in the presence of his
friends, all of whom had threatened to kill Hickok
on sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, those people couldn’t seem to make a living
any way except by robbing folks,” said the border
man after a while. “The real brains of that outfit was
a fellow called Rudabaugh—Sim Rudabaogh. I heard
that he went South; to Austin, I think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, he got some sort of Northern political pull
back of him I don’t just know how. He has given
us a fine example of organized Reconstruction politics.
He has put on foot the biggest plan of wholesale cow
stealing and land stealing and general highway robbery
that ever was started even in Texas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Using his old trade, eh? Working large?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Just now he’s getting hold of all the land
scrip the state ever issued—you know Texas retained
her own lands when she came in. His plan is to get
hold of about all of Texas north of the Buffalo gap,
and then to steal cows enough east of that to stock
the whole Staked Plains.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That sounds like a pretty large order!” smiled
Hickok.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a large order. The man is crazy who would
ever think of it. I don’t doubt that Sim Rudabaugh
is crazy—crazy with his own egotism and his success
in deeds that no sane man ever could have thought
of doing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you got any personal quarrel?” asked Hickok
of him quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That word doesn’t cover it, sir! Mr. Hickok, I
have said that Rudabaugh killed my father and Colonel
Lockhart. That is, I am practically sure of it. My
father was sheriff of Gonzales before they put me in.
I could not refuse. I knew I was elected to end the
Rudabaugh gang.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quarrel? I can’t call it by so small a name. For
every reason in the world I have got to have that man
dead or alive. And you’ll think I am crazy myself,”
he added, “when I tell you I want him alive. He is
worth much more to Texas alive than dead. The fact
is, the whole peace of Texas—and the whole end of
the big steal in Texas—depends on my bringing that
man in, not dead but alive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hickok looked at him in silence for a time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have had to shoot sometimes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Several times. I have made a good many arrests
as sheriff in my county and as a captain in the Rangers
in other counties.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hickok shook his head. A light drinker, he pushed
his glass aside not much more than tasted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No good in making arrests. There is only one way
with a man like that—let him make his break.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McMasters went on to explain the circumstances of
Colonel Griswold’s talk with Yellow Hand, below
the Washita, giving the details of the fight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We put a pretty stiff crimp into them there,” he
said. “I don’t think Rudabaugh has more than two
of his best warriors with him—Baldy Collins and
Ben Estill. He got Estill at Caldwell. He’ll maybe
pick up some more recruits over toward the Missouri
line. He’s been trailing our herd ever since we started
out, maybe a thousand miles and he’ll never quit if
he can help it. As I have explained to you, it has
been all to his interest to break up this herd. If word
of its success got back to Texas this season, that would
end his dream of cheap land and cheap cows. All
Texas would be on its guard. You see why I want to
arrest Rudabaugh. You will see, too, I’ve got to
have him alive if possible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why do you want to see me? I’m not
living in this town, though I may later. Besides, my
specialty is not taking people alive.” Wild Bill’s forehead
wrinkled in thought. “I don’t believe in arrests
for that kind of people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not so particular about any of those men
being alive except Rudabaugh,” replied McMasters.
“I haven’t got any warrant for him, and can’t get one,
and couldn’t stop to prosecute him if I had. I couldn’t
prove that he killed any of the drovers of the old
Shawnee Trail. I don’t want to prove anything. I’ve
got no warrant and no requisition papers. All I want
is to get my hands on him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I can prove that he killed the two Indian women
down near the Arbuckle Mountains. There is no white
jurisdiction down there, and in Kansas it’s no crime
to kill Indians. But there won’t be any habeas corpus
if he is ever brought before the court of the Comanches.
That’s the court I want! That’s what Griswold wants,
and he wants that because it means peace with the
Comanches. Don’t you see? It means that they’ll
come in out of Texas and go on their reservation.
That will open up everything. There’ll be any number
of cattle cross at Doan’s Store, and even further
west, as quick as the drovers know it is safe against
the Comanches, in further west than where this herd
crossed the Red.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you see, Mr. Hickok, just why I want Sim
Rudabaugh alive. That’s why I came to Abilene. I
heard you were here, and I thought maybe Rudabaugh’d
come here. If you don’t mean the law here,
there’s going to be no law in Abilene.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hickok sat for a time in silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said he at length, “I suppose I am generally
intended to keep the peace. If I help you to get
Rudabaugh in Kansas I am helping keep the peace in
Kansas. And if they want me for town marshal here
maybe I’d better give them a sample of the goods.
Every town marshal in the world ought to help a
Texas Ranger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But listen, friend,” he continued; “when two men
go into a business of this kind each puts his life in the
other man’s hands. Mostly I’d rather risk my life in
my own hands. Are you a married man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you a good shot with a revolver?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hickok rose lazily, leaving the liquor in his glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s take a walk out of doors,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stepped to the front of the saloon and stood
looking up and down the street. Some forty yards
away a sign hung out over the walk: “Dance Hall
and Saloon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll take the right-hand O,” said Hickok quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the ease of great practice and native genius—and
all the Army men rated Hickok as the best shot
with rifle or revolver that the West ever saw—he
raised one of his weapons to a high level and fired
the six shots of the single-action piece with unspeakable
rapidity. He carefully returned the gun to its
place. He did not look at the sign. He knew!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s fine work, sir,” said Dan McMasters with
undisguised enthusiasm. “Your reputation is deserved.
Quite often I doubt a man’s reputation as a shot until
I see him shoot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How about your own?” demanded Hickok. “I
myself never shoot in public. I don’t want anybody
to know how I shoot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor I. My reputation? I haven’t any this far
north.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, there’s the left-hand O. Can you see the
one I shot?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perfectly,” smiled McMasters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve a good eye. Can you hit it one time out
of six?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can hit it six times out of six, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You think so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think so—I know it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cut loose!” said Bill succinctly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For an instant McMasters stood facing his mark,
both hands poised above his heavy guns after his
invariable fashion, which had swiftly become a tradition
on the lower range. Hickok did not really see
which gun he chose, his own eye for the time being
fixed on the signboard. But a gun did rise in Dan
McMasters’ right hand. And once more, with perfect
spacing, came six reports.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time a crowd had poured out in the streets.
Men were at their heels as the two walked close to the
signboard. Wild Bill saw the six bullets grouped close,
splintering one into the other at times, not one touching
the outer rim of black.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His own eyes narrowed. He looked curiously,
studiously, at the face of the first man he had ever
been obliged to credit with pistol work approaching
his own. The face had changed. It had not lost its
concentration. It was a mask, expressionless. Hickok
studied the mask for a moment. He saw in it his own
face also. He put a hand on McMasters’ shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two turned down the street, Hickok flinging
back his long yellow hair in a gesture habitual with
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take a good look at the work on them two signs,
men,” said he, accosting the curious followers. “You
ain’t apt to see better. This man and I are going to see
peace and quiet in Abilene. He’s my friend and my
deputy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t think the man lived that could do it,”
said he to McMasters as they walked away together.
“Your six are bunched as good as mine, and your
time is perfect. Come on down to the Cottage and
let’s sit around for a while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, what’s that?” he added. A group of men
was coming up at a fast gait from the southern edge
of the town. Among them was one, apparently a
leader, whose rapid discourse occasionally was broken
by wild whoops. “Who’s that?” laughed Hickok.
“Some more wild men from down the trail?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In effect, it was Mr. McCoyne, explaining to the
citizens of Abilene that beyond a peradventure he had
met and traveled with an actual herd of cattle, actually
bound for Abilene. Moreover, the said herd was then
and there camped just below the Solomon, within
easy reach of town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This certainly was news of interest to McMasters as
well as to Wild Bill Hickok. McCoyne was too much
excited to identify any one, did not remember
McMasters, whom he had not recently seen and never
had known well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen, men!” he shouted. “We’ve got to have a
celebration. Get all the Eastern men together. Go see
if our new band is sober enough to play any sort of tune.
Get ’em down on the portico at the Drovers’ Cottage
in an hour or so. When I bring the herd into town,
and we get right opposite the Cottage, tell ’em to
strike up. We’ve got to show these people what a real
live town is.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, come on,” he resumed. “I own a interest
in the Spread Eagle Saloon”—it chanced to be the
one whose sign had served for a target just now,
later a matter of much pride to the owner—“but I’m
going to change the name to Lone Star. Come on
and have a drink with McCoyne, president of the
Abilene Stockyards!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By magic, from their tents and dugouts, their sod
huts and log hovels and their residences of raw pine
board, the men of Abilene assembled—border men,
skin hunters, loafers, gamblers, thieves, citizens and
aliens, merchants and cattle buyers; a throng sufficiently
motley for a total population of a very hundred. They
crowded into the saloon, formed an overflow meeting
upon the outside; primitive men in a primitive day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Around this primitive scene stretched a wide and
primitive world. The blue sky, flecked with fleecy
clouds, bent over an endless sea of grasses growing
to the very edge of Abilene. The flowers nodded and
beckoned in the gentle wind. Not a furrow of plow
was there. These rude men of Abilene were forerunners
of an inland empire soon to come but not
yet over the horizon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hickok and McMasters did not go beyond the edge
of the crowd. The former seemed now, as so often
he was, absorbed in the sheer beauty of the prairies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s pretty,” said he, waving his hand. “I hate
to think of its changing.” A tinge of his occasional
melancholy fell upon him. “Of course, it will change
and change fast,” said he. “Well, I was a part of
this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without affectation, he spoke in the past tense.
There never was a killer who gave himself a long life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Inside the saloon, mounted on a chair, McCoyne,
president of the Abilene Stockyards, was addressing
the multitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re a strange-looking people, them Texans,”
he was saying. “They’ve got no wagons; only some
carts, each with two yoke of oxen. There ain’t a whole
pair of breeches in the outfit, nor a decent hat. Every
morning when a fellow wants a horse, where his rope
lands, that’s his—and he has to ride to stay with it.
They can ride any horse in the world. They’ve got
a fighting chicken on top of one cart and they say they’ll
bet the herd on that rooster—and here us folks ain’t got
a single one in Abilene! They’ll bet anything you like
they’ve got the fastest horses in Kansas. They say
they’ve got a man they’ll back in a shooting match
against anybody in the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They must mean Wild Bill,” said a voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, his name is McMasters—Dan McMasters. But
he ain’t with them now. Besides that, they got something
else; you can’t guess. They’ve got a woman!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aw, go on!” A voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, they have. Young woman, too, and prettier’n
any picture you ever saw in a frame. She owns all
the herd. She’s rich as she is pretty. Her name’s
Lockhart, Miss Lockhart from Caldwell, County,
Texas, but not Caldwell, Kansas, gentlemen. She owns
the Del Sol ranch down there. They raised this whole
herd on that ranch; or anyhow that’s what they say.
Men, here’s to Miss Anastasie Lockhart, the finest girl
in the world and the first one up the Texas trail!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two men of the crowd who had been listening
quietly stepped out at the door, looking at one another
but not speaking. They passed close at hand; the
future town marshal of Abilene and his deputy.</p>

up from Texas, life was less eventful for the
Del Sol men. The cattle now were shaken down
to the daily routine of marching and gave little or no
trouble. They took the smaller streams almost in their
stride; and as to the last large waterway, no problem
of note existed, for at the Arkansas River, the trail
maker, Jesse Chisholm, again had provided passage
in the scow he had left moored not far from Wichita
after it had served his own purposes. It was merely
a procession north of the Arkansas to Abilene, across
beautifully undulating country whose attractiveness
would have been hard to match in all America.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arrived now at the Solomon River, however, almost
at the environs of Abilene, they found that civilization
had prepared a bridge—the first and only bridge of the
entire journey of perhaps a thousand miles. It was
a structure of raw pine, well meant enough, but done
by men in ignorance of the actual nature of Texas
steers. It served well enough for the carts, but the
herd would have none of it and insisted on swimming,
as they had crossed so many other streams. It was
after they had crossed that, yielding to the supplications
of McCoyne, a halt was called until the latter
could go into town and complete certain arrangements
of his own. He asked Nabours to bring on the herd
later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some anxious moments the apostle of Abilene
stood in the street looking southward. At last he
waved his hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here they come!” he cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tears ran down his face, perhaps alcoholic tears, but
not unworthy, and pulled up in his straggly beard.
He had verified his prediction. Here came the cows!</p>

<p class='pindent'>A cloud of dust approached, blown by the prairie
wind. By and by the men could see the heads of the
herd advancing steadily, a mingling sea of longhorns
in a procession interminably long. The word passed
now and even the saloons were emptied. All Abilene
came to see and welcome the first herd up the trail.
It seemed a large event to them. Not a man of them,
not the wildest dreamer of them all, ever guessed that
it was the opening of one of the greatest epochs in
American history. Men even would have scoffed at the
assertion that thirty-five thousand cattle would reach
Abilene that year, seventy-five thousand the year following;
that soon the state of Texas would be trailing
north over a million head a year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ahead and alongside, mounted on wiry little horses,
rode men ragged, coatless, long of hair, bearded; tall
men, sinewy, insouciant. The saddles of these men had
double girths, wide low horns and deep leather flaps
hanging low over the feet of the riders. Each man
had a thin hide reata coiled at his saddle horn. Each
man wore a heavy belt at which hung a heavy revolver,
and a few carried rifles under their legs. They came
easily, steadily, ahead, their own eyes full of wonder
but not of fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well to the front and paralleling the column to windward
came the great wheeled carts with white tops,
each drawn by two yoke of oxen. On the front seat of
one sat a black woman, with a long musket across her
lap. Upon yet another was an old woman, dark,
wrinkled of face, attending strictly to her own business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tilt flaps of the lead cart were closed. The
cattle which drew it followed the horseman who rode
just ahead—an old man, of face also dark and wrinkled,
who wore a very tall conical sombrero, the first of the
like ever seen in Abilene, the only one of all his company.
His cotton clothing was meager, he himself
was meager, his horse was meager. Upon his saddle
horn there was perched what proved to be a bird
whose plumage bore a luster of its own; a bird somewhat
battered and bedraggled, with certain feathers of
wing and tail missing and a crest somewhat torn and
dragging; which none the less raised its head from
time to time and emitted a loud and defiant crow. At
times Sanchez ran a thin brown hand over Gallina, his
sole surviving fighting cock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Back of this cart marched, saddled and bridled, a
singular horse, beautiful of head and crest, its dark
yellow body coat broken by white markings, a broad
band of white from side to side across its hips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the vanguard of the herd proper marched a great
gaunt steer, a giant in stature, long of limb and wide
of horn, a yellow dun in color. It now was coming
on with a rapid sidewise shuffle, not dissimilar to the
fox trot of a Southern riding horse, alertly looking
from side to side. Back of him the wide sea of other
longhorns showed, tossing in the dust. It might all
have been some circus caravan, so wholly out of human
experience it all seemed to the observers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the points of the herd rode two stalwart men,
one at either side, men who never looked at one another.
Back of them at long intervals, every four or five
hundred cattle, came the swing men; and at last the
dust of the drag—the weak, the maimed and the halt.
Back of these yet again showed the darker colors of
the remuda—some scores of horses easily handled by a
ragged, thin-shouldered, tallow-faced boy, who wore
the only pair of <span class='it'>chaparajos</span> in the company, for sake of
trousers no longer fit to see.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In all their lives these Texas cattle never had seen
a town even so great as embryonic Abilene. It took
a quarter of an hour to get them to enter the cross
street. As McCoyne had admitted that the new corrals
would hold only a fraction of the cattle, it was the
new intention to drive through the town and hold the
herd a mile or two to the north; Nabours himself
assenting thus much to the idea of a triumphal entry
merely to oblige his guide. He rode back to the lead
cart and leaned over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For God’s sake, Miss Taisie, get on Blancocito and
ride in front, why don’t you? Get on your own horse
and ride in front of your own cows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Taisie was not for triumphal entry. She stood
out for closed curtains on her cart. Through a narrow
crack she gazed out. There were countless men, but not
a single woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once headed for the cross street and crowned up by
the riders, the head of the herd, with much clacking of
horns and cracking of hoofs, advanced until it came
opposite the gallery of the Drovers’ Cottage. Now
came climax in welcome. Here the town band of
Abilene lay in ambush.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Came a sudden blare of brass—a cataclysmic thing in
its results, generously intended and not lacking precedent
in welcomes, but failing in all understanding of
a herd of Texas cattle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Probably each musician was playing the air which
pleased him best. It made no difference. With one
tremendous rush and roar the herd surged, broke, ran.
The wildly rolling tails betokened one of the sharpest
stampedes of the entire trail. Simultaneously the great
majority of the saddle ponies began efforts to disencumber
themselves of their riders, in whom they now
apparently had lost all confidence. Had the population
of Abilene sought a circus, they needed now no more
than to look about them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The band played on, as those having engaged in an
undertaking which they did not like to discontinue.
But they played on to an empty house. The Del Sol
herd was gone!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The riders leaned once more into the work, headed
by Nabours, profoundly cursing all brass bands, in a
run the worst they had seen, even in their abundant
experience. The men of Abilene had the first and
finest opportunity of their lives to see a herd of wild
Texas cattle handled as no men other than these could
have done the work. Even for these it took time and
distance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sudden burst of melody had left the cattle without
concertedness. They broke into different bands,
even deserting their vanguard. Of the latter, old
Alamo, the giant steer that had paced the herd for a
thousand miles, alone held to the proper course. Alamo
laid back his horns and raised his muzzle like some wild
elk. He dashed past the mob, past the band at the
Drovers’ Cottage, past everything of Abilene except the
railroad and the stockyards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pore old Alamo!” said Jim Nabours later. “He
shore knowed which way was north, but he didn’t seem
to know nothing else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The head of old Alamo with its immense sweep of
horns in later years long was known in the general
freight office of a Western railroad, where, had he then
retained his faculties, he might at every hour of the
day and night have noted sight and sound of railway
activities. But at the time then current, Alamo had
never seen a bit of railroad iron in all his life. Perhaps
to his startled gaze the two twisting lines of steel
were two giant snakes. In any event, Alamo swerved
suddenly, trying to evade them. His hard hoofs slipped
on the metals and he fell. His right foreleg, doubled
under him, snapped below the knee under his own
weight and that of two other steers which had made
bold to follow him. So there he lay, much like other
figures in completed destiny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Engaged in opposite directions, not many of the
men of Abilene or of Del Sol noted what happened.
There came out of the dust, spurring forward, only
one slim ragged rider—who even had left his beloved
horses—the boy Cinquo Centavos who, so it seemed,
had some sort of admiration and understanding of the
lead steer of Del Sol.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Excited, tears streaming down his dusty face as
always in his moments of tension, Cinquo spurred up
to the railroad track and sprang down where the great
steer lay struggling. His was the first rope that ever
sang in Abilene streets. It caught the great steer over
the horns and laid him flat, the pony setting back even
as his rider left the saddle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Alamo!” wept Cinquo, seating himself on the
steer’s muzzle to quiet his plunging. “You done busted
that laig plumb off!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, ain’t that too bad!” said one of the more sober
musicians, who now strolled over from the Drovers’
Cottage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here, you!” commanded Cinquo. “You go back to
that cart where the nigger woman is at and get her to
give you the hide of that yearlin’ we killed yesterday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gentlemen,” continued Cinquo, drawing himself up
to his full height, after he had the victim properly
strung out, “this may be a cow town, but you-all don’t
know nothing about cows. Now look at that! Just
because it’s Fourth of July, you think you got any
right to bust the best damn steer that ever come out
of Texas?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alamo and Cinquo were to take the first curtain
call. The boy was no theorist. Under his direction
they brought him some pieces of barrel staves.
Around these he wound again and again strips of
the green hide, stretching it tight—perhaps the first
surgery on a Texas steer, if not the last, ever known
on the long trail up from the Southern lands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rawhide,” explained Cinquo to the gathering
group, “is the holdin’est thing there is. Once that
dries, that steer’s laig will be a lot better’n new—if it
don’t dry too tight. Is them the pens over yon?” he
continued. “Well, swing a pole acrost the sides of
the chute. Some of you-all go and git some grass or
hay. We’ll make a belly-band o’ the rest of the hide
and swing him up offen the ground so it won’t hurt his
sore laig.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This here steer’s name is Alamo,” he explained to
his audience. “He’s the onliest Texas cow or horse I
ever knowed to have a name. But he started through.
What us Texans starts we finishes. Git back now and
leave me if he can stand up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old Alamo, relieved of rope and with no weight
on his neck, proved his mettle by springing to his feet
as though nothing had happened, and only the strange
feeling in his foreleg prevented his charging the crowd
as an evidence of good faith. But Cinquo impressed
Sanchez, who was visible coming up, and Alamo yielded
to the force of numbers and of skill. A man flung
open the gate of the Abilene Stockyards. Alamo
entered in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s one game steer,” said McCoyne, when later
he found him there in place, in solitary grandeur.
“If five hundred dollars will buy that steer he’s mine
right now, and I’ll keep him as long as he lives.
Hurrah for old Alamo, the first steer up the trail!
Strike up some more music again, fellows; he can’t
get away now. Show my friends from Texas what
a Fourth of July can be in Abilene.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But a certain thought came to the mind of Mr.
McCoyne upon the instant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve forgot about that young lady in the cart,”
said he. “Anyhow, she ain’t stampeded. I told you
we had a woman along, and now I’ll prove it. Come on,
men, march in front and play your damnedest. I’m
going to fetch her up to the Cottage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The landlord and manager of the Drovers’ Cottage
was an Eastern man imported for this special purpose
of running a hostelry devoted to trail men, and now
on his trial trip. His name—which so far as he is
concerned is of no consequence—was Gore. His
wife’s name, which for years was of very great consequence
in all Kansas, was Lou Gore. A portly
woman she was, with a heart as large as that of any
ox that ever came up the trail. Of Lou Gore’s countless
acts of charity, of her unceasing ministrations to the
ill and the afflicted, the wounded and the impoverished
men of the old trail, history has written all too little.
She was known sometimes as the Mother of Abilene,
sometimes as the Mother of Kansas; more often as the
Mother of the Cowboys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As yet Lou Gore had small acquaintance of those
mad scenes which so soon were to become a regular
experience with her. But now the carpenters had
her new hotel almost completed, nearly ready for
occupancy. Somewhat flustered that she had not quite
finished sweeping out after the carpenters, not quite
put up all her curtains—for curtains she insisted upon
at the cottage—the landlady of that edifice came to the
front door in time to see some of the incidents above
recorded. Therefore, duly, as she hid her hands under
her apron, she heard the reassembled musicians once
more essaying sweet sounds, saw the procession of
pedestrians advancing toward her door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then Lou Gore saw, after a second and more
careful look, what she had not expected to see—a tall
and beautiful young girl, an astonishingly and strikingly
beautiful young girl, who now for the first time parted
the curtains of her conveyance and sprang lightly to
the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taisie Lockhart, in men’s clothing—a thing then
almost equivocal for a woman—stood looking about her
as though about to fly. She seemed so much alone,
so helpless, so appealing, that the only other real woman
of Abilene ran to her and took her into her hospitable
arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, you poor dear!” said she. “You poor dear!
You’re a girl, ain’t you! Of course, I knew! Now
you come right on in!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Taisie Lockhart, the first woman ever to cross
the doorstep of the Drovers’ Cottage, with the exception
of Lou Gore herself, came right on in. And as
she passed the door and started toward the hall which
opened from the front-office room she saw standing
before her the man she had hoped and feared she
would never see again—Dan McMasters.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>O</span></span>N the flat prairie, whose solid turf offered
good footing to the ponies, the Del Sol riders,
cursing their luck, finished rounding up their
stampeded cattle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m willing to admit there is such a place as Aberlene
now,” grumbled Nabours, “but it ain’t inhabitated
by no human beings. This here idea of meeting a herd
of cows with a brass band ain’t no ways according to
no kind of Hoyle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ain’t taking no more chances about going through
town,” he added. “We’ll throw them around the
town and stop about three mile north. Ef anybody
wants to see them cows they’ve got to come out there
to our camp, and not bring no brass band neither.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wherefore, with exception of the few head already
penned in the Abilene Stockyards, the Del Sol herd
circumvented Abilene and all its attractions, and finally
turned out on good grazing ground north of town.
When at length the cattle were quiet and grazing the
men pulled up with a feeling of vast relief, which
each expressed in his own way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, boys,” said the trail boss to those nearest
him, “here’s where we lean our saddles on the ground
for a while. Tell Buck to pitch about here. The
other cart’ll likely stay in town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the last camp at the end of the road, farthest
north for any Texan longhorn at that hour. The long
days and nights of trail work now were over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anita helped the cook to unload the cart which
nominally was his, although he rarely had driven it.
Strange and complex seemed the cargo as it was
heaped up on the prairie. The three saddles of the
lost men, their bridles and others; bed rolls and saddle
blankets, kettles, pots and pans; ox yokes and trace
chains; spurs, hair ropes and hide reatas; collapsed
sacks of meal and flour and beans; some slabs of side
meat, a mess box and a coffee mill, sections of several
dried rawhides—all mingling with the meager war
bags of a score of men. There were even a pair of
horns of giant size, detached from the head of an
aged steer whose neck had not proven able to withstand
the pull of two reatas when it was attempted
to haul him out of a quicksand crossing where he had
bogged down. Len Hersey had chopped them off and
put them in the cart, declaring that he wanted them for
a “soo-vee-ner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We got all the comforts o’ home now,” remarked
that insouciant soul as he rode by. “Maybe I kin
trade them horns fer a shirt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours waited until he saw the cattle well scattered
and disposed to feed, and until he saw the dust of the
remuda coming in at a run, Cinquo Centavos and
Sanchez by this time having completed their surgery
on Alamo. He straightened in his saddle and drew
tighter his belt, pushing his hat back on his furrowed
forehead. Even now the burden of his responsibility
was on his shoulders, and would be until the herd was
sold; and the proximity of town brought certain problems.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Del”—he turned to his point man, whom he found
seated on the ground engaged in wiping and reloading
his revolver—“you ride on down to the hotel and tell
Miss Taisie I want her to stay in town to-night at
the hotel. She’ll be safe with Milly along. The rest
of us will come in when we can; maybe some to-night.
This is the Fourth of July by the almanac, but there
ain’t going to be no Fourth of July so long as there
is any chance of this here bunch of cows taking another
run; and, of course, we can’t tell just when we’ll
make any kind of sale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some of the men were disposed to grumble at the restriction
of their range liberties, but the trail boss remained
firm. Del Williams, quiet as usual, mounted
and rode off toward town. He looked over his shoulder
as he rode off alone toward the town, whose smoke
was distinguishable across the prairies. Most of the
other men were off at edges of the herd, all of them
intent on gentling them down, with the exception of
one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cal Dalhart knew that an agreed truce now had
terminated. Up to this time both he and Williams had
stood by their promise to let their quarrel wait until
they had reached Abilene; and, truth to say, both
scrupulously had refrained from word or act of hostility
till now. But at the suspicion that his rival intended
to forestall him, the pent-up wrath of Dalhart
blazed high upon the instant. Without asking consent
of any one he spurred out from his own place on the
herd a quarter of a mile away. Nabours saw him, but
could not or did not attempt to call him back. He shook
his head; a sense of impending trouble came to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who was that man rid off yan just now, boy?”
Dalhart demanded of Buck the cook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who dat? Why dat’s Mister Del. He rid pint
wif you all summer—you doan know him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dalhart spurred off, but did not overtake his man
outside the town limits. He saw Williams’ horse
standing with the reins down in front of the door
of the Drovers’ Cottage, near to Taisie’s cart; a sight
which filled him with rage. A few moments later
he himself flung off and also entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Williams had found the office room empty. Hearing
voices, as he thought on the floor above, he passed
upstairs, ignorant of the ways of hotels and looking
for some one who might tell him where he might find
Miss Taisie Lockhart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He exulted in the success of their experiment as
though the herd were all his own. His eyes were
filled with a glorious picture. In fancy he saw her
triumphant, as though swimming upon a cloud, radiant,
scarce touching the earth. He had seen her thus in
camp a hundred times, himself standing apart, distant,
hungrily regarding. No actual interview between them
had taken place since they had left the home ranch
of Del Sol. He never had declared himself actually,
never had spoken a word of his love. She had seemed
always a divinity too far off for his aspirations. But
now he was about to see her. He swore now he would
touch her hand, would stand face to face with her
alone. The thought of this was too much for Del
Williams. Suddenly he began to tremble in his fear
of her and his great and terrible love for her, as reverent
and as loyal as any love man ever bore a woman. His
courage left him. His limbs grew weak. Seeking a
temporary truce with the situation, he turned into
one of the little rooms which made off from the narrow
hall and seated himself upon the bed, intending to pull
himself together before he sought her further.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dalhart, following up his quarry, also found the
office empty. Hearing footfalls on the floor above, he
also ran up the stair, looking for the man whom he
knew to be somewhere in the house—the hotel was not
yet really fully open for business. He found himself
also in the upper hall, a long Marathon course between
rows of doors all just alike, leading into rooms all just
alike, all furnished just alike and each divided from
the others by a shackling raw board partition, of ceiling
loosely tongued and grooved. In each room was
a single chair, a single washbowl, a single towel, a
single bar of soap, a single coat hook on the back of
the door. In each room sat a single bed, in each precisely
at the same place—against the partition near the
single window and facing the single door. Hotel
making and hotel keeping still were in their infancy
in Kansas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seeing no one in the hall, and still seeking for the
sound he had heard, Dalhart, moody and blood mad—a
more ruthless and dangerous man than Williams—entered
one of these rooms to peer about. He found
no one, flung himself down upon the bed. He leaned
against the partition, causing it to rock somewhat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Del Williams heard him but did not know who he
was. He sat up, listening, his hand on his revolver,
for a situation of doubt was usually one of danger
in that border country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two men now were but a few yards apart,
though separated by three of the thin board partitions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dalhart called aloud, “You Williams! Where are
you? You are hiding, you damned sneak! Come on
out if you dare!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Williams heard his call. He rose eagerly to meet
the challenge, fear of any man unknown in his heart,
his weapon in his hand ready to meet this man. A
swift thought came to him that he had been riding
hard, so that the caps on the cylinder tubes might
have become disengaged. He pulled up the revolver
and overran the cylinder rapidly to see that the piece
was in perfect order, as now it needed to be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dalhart heard the movement somewhere beyond him.
He stepped to his own door just as Williams was about
to emerge at his. Then came a report. Immediately
upon it came a grunt or groan, the fall of the body of
a man upon the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Del Williams was himself in a flash. He fully had
intended to shoot Dalhart deliberately. Now he had
shot him practically by accident. The barrel, which
happened to be just at the level of the man’s body
as Williams whirled the cylinder, discharged the heavy
ball as fatally as though by intent. The hammer must
have been hit with his thumb. He never knew how it
happened; no man ever does know how these things
happen. The bullet pierced one partition after another.
It had force enough left, driven by the heavy charge of
fine rifle powder, to penetrate also the chest wall of a
man’s body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dalhart fell, nor was it given to him to see the man
who had killed him. If ever he heard the running feet
of that man, or saw his glance cast into the room as he
ran, no one ever could tell. He was dead the instant
after the ball struck him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A man met Williams in the front room, at the
foot of the stair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was that?” he demanded. “Who shot?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Williams smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon some fellow up there must have let off his
gun by mistake. Maybe he has got too much liquor
on board. Leave him go; he won’t hurt nobody.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He passed out deliberately; deliberately gathered the
reins of his horse; deliberately swung into the saddle
and turned down the street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dan McMasters and Wild Bill Hickok, a block away,
both had heard the sound of the shot and were walking
toward the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How are you, Del!” called McMasters. “I’m glad
you got through all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Del Williams stopped, leaned over and shook hands
with McMasters, whom he had not seen north of the
Washita crossing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, everything’s fine,” said he. “We’re holding
the herd about three miles north. Come on out and
see us. So long. I got to be going now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He waved his hand, passed on at a gentle trot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Del Williams did not hold his trot. He did not
ride to a saloon, neither did he swing northward out
of town to join the herd. To the contrary, he jerked
his horse’s head around to the south, sunk home the
spurs and left town, heading south, as fast as a good
cow horse could carry him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many men saw him cross the town of Abilene at
speed, but a cowman on a running horse was no new
sight on that busy day. Liquor was flowing at every
bar. Del Williams, coatless, penniless, ragged, bearded,
unkempt, not a dollar in a pocket and without a morsel
of food, had no one to say him nay as he headed back
down the long trail which just now had found its
end. Plenty of men remembered how he looked. But
no man, friend or stranger, ever looked on him again
in that part of the world. He disappeared as though
some quicksand had engulfed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So passed poor Del Williams, as good a cowman
as ever crossed the Red River. Poor Del Williams, for
after all he had not seen the face of the woman whom
he adored, had not touched her hand, had never spoken
to her a word of the love he had given her since his
own boyhood. He knew that a murderer might never
look into her face. True, he knew that the record of the
shot, piercing the several partitions, would have been
a perfect alibi as an accidental case of homicide. But
he knew also that he had been a murderer in his heart.
So he never looked into Taisie Lockhart’s eyes and
never touched her hand at all. And to this day no
man knows what ever became of Del Williams, for no
word ever came back from him. Perhaps he got into
Old Mexico; perhaps he disappeared somewhere in the
Indian Nations; perhaps he lived to old age and perhaps
he did not live twenty-four hours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dan McMasters and Wild Bill Hickok, quasi officers
of the law, after their hurried investigation, looked one
into the other’s eyes and agreed that it would have been
absolutely impossible for a man to kill another man in
that way except by accident. In that case, and in
Abilene at that time, there remained no need to question
the killer or to pursue him. Neither of them
asked or mentioned the name of the rider heading
south, and if either had a suspicion, neither voiced it.</p>

to converse with Cinquo Centavos, the fourteen-year-old
horse herder. They sat their horses in
the sunshine, watching the distant herd contentedly
grazing. The wind was very soft and the sky very
blue. Life would have been a pleasant thing for them
both had they not been so close to town. They planned
metropolitan conquest, both of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to take a ride on the railroad kyars afore I
go back home,” resumed Cinquo. “If I didn’t, my
folks wouldn’t think I wasn’t much noways.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Them kyars probably don’t go nowheres near where
you live at,” replied Len. “I don’t feel like taking no
chances. Ef I am on a horse I’m all right; but ef a
man’s on the kyars, where is he?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you was in town what would you advise fer
to buy first, Cinquo?” he continued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some onions and some fried potatoes and pie first,
I reckon,” replied the boy. “Then some ammernition.
Then maybe I’d get my hair cut. I had orter have some
new pants. I mean ef I had any money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then a shave?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy blushed red.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon I can get shaves if I pay the man,” said
he, “and I reckon I am going to have plenty of money
afore long. What’re you going to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fust thing I am going to do when I get to town,”
replied Len, “I am going to get a drink.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His companion gazed in deep thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I think I’ll get another drink. Fur as I
can see now, that’s about how I’m going to perceed.
Of course, I may take both drinks at oncet. I can
take other things under advisement, as the justice of
the peace said. Maybe I would buy me a new pair
pants; maybe I’d work around to the barber atter a
while. When I got fixed up I might go and see what
kind o’ dancin’ was in this town. Oh, yes! I did fergit
about my shirt. I may buy me a shirt—ef there’s any
kind of monte played in Aberlene.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They both saw approaching across the prairies to
the eastward a low-lying cloud of smoke. It was the
first railroad train either of them had ever seen. They
became very much excited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look at her come!” said Cinquo. “Bet I ain’t
skeered to ride on that thing! Now you see!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a long ways off when you say it!” scoffed
Len Hersey. “She’s goin’ to look a heap bigger and
dangerouser, clost up. I bet we’d have to blindfold
you and put two ropes on you afore we could put you on
that there train, and then you’d be so skeered you’d
shake your spurs off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ain’t got no more shakes than what you have,”
said the boy. “You ain’t saw any more railroad kyars
than what I have. But I don’t reckon I’ll go to town
untel we sell our cows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor me,” nodded Len. “But did you ever see such
a town like this here one, now? They don’t savvy dobe
none, it seems like; they don’t dry no mud; they just
cut slabs of grass roots and build ’em up into a house,
and put on a dirt roof. I looked inside of one as I
rid by. It was lined with red caliker, walls and ceilings;
no gypsum to white it up, nor nothing. Yet humans
was livin’ in it. They live in them dugouts, too—just
push a hole back into a bank an’ crawl in atter the hole
like badgers. An’ there ain’t no trees; an’ when they
do have trees, hain’t no moss on ’em. I ain’t saw a
cactus nowheres, an’ as fer mesquite, I’m a notion to
ride into one o’ these plum thickets an’ stick some plum
thorns in my laigs, so’s’t a feller kin feel more nache’l.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meantime the continuous shriek of the locomotive
whistle had brought to the station practically the entire
population of the city of Abilene. It was a great day—a
trail herd and a railroad train all in one day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the four coaches which made up the train there
now descended an astonishing number of men, comprising
all sorts and conditions of humanity. Some
obviously were Eastern, and as many bore the imprint
of the border. All of them pushed on toward the head
of the train. There was no station building. The
Drovers’ Cottage stood then for all of Abilene, and in
that general direction the newcomers made their way.
The ubiquitous McCoyne was first to greet them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right this way, gentlemen!” said he. “Let me lead
you to our hotel, the finest in the West. Welcome to
Abilene, my friends! Yonder is the stockyards. I
suppose some of you are looking after cattle. There
is some in there now, and there is three thousand
more right north of town. If you’re looking for cattle,
we’ve got them and don’t you never doubt it! Gentlemen,
you certainly have come to the right place. Boys,
where’s the band?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With some sort of instinct of his own McCoyne
more especially addressed a quiet-looking sandy-bearded
man in dark clothing, who seemed to be a man of distinct
purposes and direct methods in life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How’d you like to ride out this evening and see our
herd? They’ve just got in from Texas this morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stranger made a noncommittal reply to the
effect that he was hungry. The crowd of newcomers
began to disintegrate. Men looked after their hand
bags, their rifles. Picturesque, certainly, was the personnel
of every westbound train in Kansas at that time,
when the head of steel was but little beyond the boom
town of Abilene, first cow camp of Kansas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hickok and McMasters stood near the door of the
Drovers’ Cottage, looking at the stirring and curious
scene before them. The man of the Northern border
was quiet after his fashion, moody. He turned suddenly
to Dan McMasters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look at them come!” he said. “Next year they’ll
be here in thousands; and there’ll be cattle here in
thousands too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McMasters nodded. The older man went on:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me give you some advice. There is going to be
big money in raising and selling cattle right up in this
country; more money than there will be in trailing them
north and selling at the road. If you’ll listen to me,
you’ll get some land of your own up here. I’ll tell you
where you can get a ranch, and a good one, over on the
Smoky Hill, with all outdoors for your pasture. Put
some cows on there. They’ll get fatter here than they
ever will in Texas, though you don’t believe it. I’ve
seen cattle up here, around the Army posts—and fat
too. There’s no money in selling thin cattle. You’ll
find that out if you keep at it. I’ve lived up here,
north of the tick line, longer than you have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McMasters nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been studying this country now for quite a
while,” said he. “I’ve seen some wintered cattle up
in here, and as you say they were heavier. There’s a
lot to be learned by Texas men. They don’t know
that there is any world north of thirty-six. They’re
still fighting the war, down in my state.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huh! Well, this trial outlet for your cattle’ll end
the war quicker than all your speech makers ever
will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” he continued, “if you settle down to
ranching you’ve got to get married some time. It’s a
hard life for a woman here on the front, with the
Indians not so far away. They tell me you have brought
a young woman up here with this herd. I haven’t seen
her. Lou Gore took her in charge and I’ll bet she’ll
keep her close. She’s young? She can ride? Why
don’t you marry her and settle down up here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed at his conceit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can bring up cattle from below as fast as you
need more stock. Marry and settle down, son, and go
into the sheriff business up here. I’ll give you my
recommendation that you’re the best pistol shot I ever
saw, unless it’s myself, and I’m not any too damn sure
of that last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d bring Agnes out here if I was in a little different
line of work myself,” he added. “That’s my wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No man ever heard him speak in other but terms
of gentleness of the woman who had married him,
knowing what he was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have got to finish my work first before I can
settle down,” said Dan McMasters, almost as sad and
moody as his companion here—indeed, singularly like
to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly he touched the arm of Wild Bill, spoke in
a low voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look!” said he, “Don’t move! There’s our man!
That’s Rudabaugh down there by the last car! So
that’s the way he took to get here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” smiled Hickok, only amusement on his face.
“He’s got here too late to stop that herd from making
Abilene.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; but he got here at just the right time, for
all that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McMasters’ face was cold. The mask of expressionlessness
again was covering it. His eyes, narrow, the
skin of the upper eyelids drawn triangularly down,
never left the man for whom so long and patiently he
had been waiting.</p>

left the coaches nearly empty. The head of
steel was to the westward and new towns were
projected for thirty miles; but the greater fame of
Abilene, the city of the future stockyards, capital
of a coming cow trade, still acted as magnet for a
majority of the traders and buyers, adventurers,
hunters, all the curious-minded gentry then eagerly
exploiting a West which never yet had lived. The
rumors of northern drives of Texas cattle had in some
way gone abroad; this first arrival was a news event
of the first water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before these arrivals now spread the vastest, sweetest
empire that ever fell to gaze of any adventurers of
new fortunes. The very feel of it was in the warm but
vital air that blew across the waving prairies; lay in the
far horizon that swept untarnished by any settler’s
smoke, far as the eye might reach. The flowers here
also had not yet known a bee and there was not a
weed. At times the edge of the buffalo grass was east
of the Western border. The bluestem had not yet
fully got to Abilene. The buffalo that year moved
a little farther west. Their wallows dotted the surface
of the earth thereabout for years to come. The great
checkerboard of the gods, four vast spaces in the
corners of the greatest crossroads of the world, still
lay out as the Range—mesquite and grama in the Southwest,
bunch grass and buffalo grass in the Northwest;
native—and later bluestem—grasses in the Northeast;
redtop and its fellows in the Southeast; all lapping, encroaching,
passing, augmenting as the swift years
altered the range. From Spanish-moss lands to the
sagebrush steppes, from the scant grama to the waist-high
green, lay the country of the cows. At that time
it was but imperfectly known. The original, the aboriginal
titles had not yet been extinguished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The raw little village of itself meant not so much
to most of these men, who had seen such villages before,
east of the Missouri. The scanty edifices were
accepted at least as sufficient. There were saloons,
stores, a hotel. The travelers looked to their weapons
and their luggage, and then, each after his own fashion,
headed out toward the signs which made offerings to
civilized man. Most went to the saloons, a few moved
toward the Drovers’ Cottage, where even now, before
her formal opening, Lou Gore was making mankind
comfortable on the frontier. Others wandered up and
down the street, gazing this way or that. None passed
the corrals of the Abilene Stockyards without a curious
gaze at the gaunt, long-haired creatures which now
marked a renaissance of the entire cattle trade in
America. It all was crude, young, new and unspeakably
alluring—this strange new world, offspring of time
and the whim of the immortal gods at play on their
great four-squared checkerboard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McMasters called Hickok aside, spoke to him quietly,
after a time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our men have gone over to the new saloon,” said
he. “I see one is headed for the Twin Livery Barn.
They’ve probably got horses there, or are looking for
some.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Hickok, “you know them best. They
haven’t made any break yet and I’ve got nothing on
them. None of them ever harmed me. What’s the
game?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want you to watch them for a little while,” replied
McMasters. “I’ll not leave much to you except the
watching. I’ll be with you very soon. Just now I
want to find out what’s going to be done about the sale
of this herd. McCoyne has got some man in tow;
and yon’s Nabours, the Del Sol trail boss—he’s just
come in. I think I ought to know what goes on there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McCoyne, the exuberant and irresistible prophet of
Abilene, indeed now was bringing forward a stranger,
a bearded, stocky, self-contained man of nondescript
dress, yet rather of Western look himself. The three
little groups now joined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. McMasters,” begun McCoyne, “and you, too,
Mr. Nabours, and Marshal Hickok, this, now, is Mr.
Pattison, just come to town. He’s in the market to
buy some range stuff. He’s been in the packing business
in Indianapolis for several years, and he has just
come out to Junction City, a couple of hours over east,
to start a packing plant of his own out here; though I
don’t see why he didn’t pick on Abilene for that. Anyhow
he has to come here for his cattle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good morning, gentlemen,” said the stranger thus
introduced, smiling humorously. “I am glad to meet
you. Yes, I am looking for some cattle. I don’t
know how you guessed it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’d you want them delivered?” inquired Jim
Nabours, coming to the thing on his own mind. “We
got some cows. I can testify they’re good travelers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, not far,” replied Pattison. “That some of
your cattle over in the pens? Junction City is just
over here a couple of days’ march. I am going to try
to pack a few cattle in there this year. I shouldn’t wonder
if we started some stockyards in Kansas City before
long. My friend, old Mitch, has been talking of it
a long time. If they get the yards it won’t be long
until a packing house is started there. That would
save a lot of distance in shipping East.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know that two Milwaukee and Chicago men—Plankinton
is the name of one and Armour, I think,
is the other man—well, they are figuring on going into
the packing-house business in Kansas City. They’ve
got a man out there now, looking things over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then where does it leave you at Junction City?”
demanded McCoyne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pattison spread out his hands with a shrug.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, their man is crazy. He’s talking of
using a hundred thousand cattle every year. I shouldn’t
wonder if they did put down half that many. All this
Western country is going to take a mighty jump
since the railroad has gone West. That’s why I am
here, of course. I’ve come out to look over this whole
business myself. If it’s all the same to you I’d like to
look over your herd. Mr. McCoyne says it isn’t far out
to where you are holding it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How’d right now do?” asked Nabours calmly.
“How much time do you want to look over our cows?
With me it’s sharp’s the word and quick’s the motion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About five minutes. I’ve seen your sample in the
corrals here. How much a pound do you figure you
ought to get?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How much a pound? I don’t know nothing about
that. I don’t know how much a cow weighs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I can tell you. One of your sample steers
will weigh about nine hundred pounds. They look like
greyhounds crossed on a window shutter. Two cents
a pound would be a lot for them. Now, a fat steer will
weigh twelve hundred instead of nine hundred, and
he’ll bring four cents instead of two. Say I give
you eighteen dollars for your lean steers, right off the
trail. I could give you thirty-six dollars if they was
fat; say if they’d been wintered up here and fed north.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mister,” said Jim Nabours, “you’re talking foolish,
though pleasing. I don’t know how much nine hundred
pounds is, nor twelve hundred pounds; but when you
tell me any Texas steer is worth more than thirty
dollars you make me think you ain’t got no money to
buy nothing. You don’t mean to say that in the presence
of witnesses?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I certainly do mean to say it,” rejoined Pattison.
“But that isn’t all. Your Texas steers will bring a good
deal more than thirty dollars when you have taken
time to move them up north of the edge of winter
and ranged them and fattened them and bred the horns
off of them. That can all be done in five years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ain’t got no five years,” said Jim Nabours. “You
allowed five minutes will do. Well, let’s climb on top
our broncs and ride out and see; it’s only about two
miles or so north.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, Dan.” He turned towards McMasters.
“Ride along with us. I rely some on your judgment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McMasters turned toward Hickok with a quiet word
or so, and waving his hand strolled off to pick up his
own horse. McCoyne, anxious as he was to see a
trade effected, did not dare forsake the city of Abilene
at so critical a time. The newly christened Lone Star
was full. Besides, he was mayor of the town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bill,” said he, accosting Hickok, “I got you here
now, and I’m going to have you elected town marshal.
We can’t hold any election right now, and we may need
a town marshal right soon. I appoint you marshal
right now, and Mr. McMasters as your deputy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hickok looked at him lazily and smiled.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='365' id='Page_365'></span><h1>CHAPTER XLII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>TWENTY STRAIGHT ON THE PRAIRIE</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>T</span></span>HE great herd, scattered over a mile of grazing
ground, by now was well quieted. Wearied
by their own exertions, some of the animals
were lying down, as though aware that the end of their
journey was at hand; the remainder scattered, grazing
contentedly. Men were on guard here and there at
the edges of the herd; others were at the fire, eating. A
sudden excitement arose among the cow hands when
word passed that a buyer was on the scene, for so they
interpreted the advent of Nabours and his companions.
Nabours waved a hand with genuine cowman enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look at them!” he exclaimed. “Did you ever see
a finer outfit of cows in your borned days, Mr.
Pattison?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The face of the trader remained expressionless,
though his eyes were busy as he rode.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve got some she-stock in here,” said he at
length; “some yearlings in too. I should say, too,
that you’ve got several sorts of brands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, maybe we have,” said Nabours. “I’d have
a damned sight more if we had not hit so much country
where there wasn’t no cows coming north. This here
herd belongs to a orphant, Mr. Pattison, and in our
country they ain’t no questions asked about orphants;
the law of brands don’t run on orphants. We put up
this herd in our own country. Our road brand is a
Fishhook, and when you buy a Fishhook steer you
are buying our support of the brand—twenty good
men that can shoot. I got to sell these cows straight
too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pattison reined up, still dubious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me tell you something. I know beef—that’s
my trade. You’ve got maybe three or four hundred
of light stuff and shes. They don’t pack well. Still,
here I am with a good ranch over on the Smoky Hill.
It hasn’t got a head of stock on it yet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I just took in the land and water and trusted to
God for the cattle. I know where the real money is,
and it isn’t in buying lean fours. If I had any way
to handle these stockers over on my ranch I’d take
your herd straight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t split no cows,” said Jim Nabours. “It’s all
or none. I got to sell all these cows afore dark. We
both allowed that five minutes was plenty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it is,” said Pattison quietly. “I trade as
quick as anybody, and I don’t go to the saloon first,
as two or three other men have, whom I happen to
know, that came on that train. Now I’ll tell you what
I’ll do: If you’ll hold out that stuff below the fours
I’ll give you twenty straight for your fours, right here
on the prairie. Five thousand cash down, balance in
draft on the First National of Kansas City.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly Dan McMasters turned to Nabours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The herd is sold,” said he. “Twenty a head, straight
through.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you mean, Dan?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am taking all the she-stuff and stackers for myself.
Let Mr. Pattison have the fours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what’re you going to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am thinking of starting a Northern ranch for
myself. It don’t take me long to decide either. I
believe Mr. Pattison is right. There’s where the
money is. Besides, I’m leaving Texas before long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pattison turned toward him with his quizzical smile,
estimating him after his own fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You bid me up, young man,” said he; “but you’ve
sold this herd, yearlings and all, at twenty straight on
the prairie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, we’ve got plenty time left—two minutes by
the watch. I’ll give you just a minute and a half to
think of me as your partner in my ranch on the Smoky
Hill, myself to own half this stuff you’ve just bought
in, you to trail a fresh herd up to us next year and to
run this upper ranch for me—all dependent on your
investigation of me back East, preferably by telegraph
to-night. I’ve got the land, you’ve got the cows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll show you how to get three-four-five cents a
pound for beef on the hoof. What do you say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McMasters turned his own cool gray eyes upon the
other, regarding him with a like smile as their eyes met,
and their hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have traded,” said he quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours looked from one to the other, scratching his
head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then is my cows sold?” he demanded. “Do we
get twenty straight?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You heard us,” said Pattison. “There is a new
company on the new northern range—the PM brand.
Mr. McMasters is my partner; you see, I know something
about him already. And I want to say to you,
sir, you are on the road to more money than you could
ever make in Texas. We’ll cut this stuff and tally out
to-morrow if it pleases you. Come on over to the fire,
partner; let’s light down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Each in his mood, Nabours somewhat chastened as
he endeavored to figure out how much the five minutes’
work had meant to him, they moved to where the giant
cart of Buck the cook loomed on the level prairie.
Pattison reached into the pocket of his coat and drew
out a great package of folded bills, which he tossed on
the ground before him as he reached for his coffee
cup.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think that’s five thousand dollars,” said he. “I
can’t carry much cash with me, of course. In town,
I’ll give you a draft on the First National of Kansas
City for fifty-five thousand more if the herd tallies out
three thousand head. I am almost ready to take your
own tally.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Jim Nabours, “we haven’t tallied out since
the last run; I been scared to. If we hadn’t had no bad
luck down the trail there wouldn’t ’a’ been money
enough in Kansas City to buy all them cows we started
with. Do you mean to say to me that you’re going to
give me sixty thousand dollars for them cows?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I certainly am if you don’t object too much about
it. And I call this a good day’s work. I have bought
the first northern-trail herd. Besides, I have got a
partner and a manager for my ranch, and a line of
supply for the ranch, too. Yes, I call it a good five
minutes’ work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall have all the time you want to put up
your half for these stockers, Mr. McMasters,” he
added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want any time,” replied Dan McMasters.
“I can raise a little money. You see, I know the history
of this herd. I’d almost have been ready to buy it
straight through at twenty a head myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was afraid you would,” said Pattison. “But I
wanted the cows and a partner too. All right, take
your pleasure as to your half of the northern ranch ante.
I tell you, I am going to make you more money than
either of us ever made in our lives. Lord, this is just
the beginning of things! What a fine world it is out
here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned to the others as he went on, tin cup of
coffee in hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, I am banking on two things that you Texas
men didn’t know anything about. One is the stockyards
at Kansas City. The other is a packing business in
Kansas City. There’s going to be the market for this
range stuff. Meantime I’ll have to get some of your
boys to drive these fours over to Junction City for
me. I’ll buy all your ponies except what you need
to get back home. My partner and I will need some
horses for the PM outfit on the Smoky Hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t blame you for not seeing the game very
far ahead up here,” he went on. “This is a colder
country than you are used to. But if I can hire some
of your men to run the herd for us, they can build
dugouts in a few days like those you saw in town,
and hole up warm and snug for the winter. After a
while you’ll begin to make hay, but you’ll need a whole
lot less than you think right now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are going to start the first winter ranch on the
heels of the first herd north of thirty-six. I am going
to show you that cows will do a heap better when you
fatten them north of the edge of winter and north
of the tick line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is our five minutes up? I don’t like to waste time
here. Let’s go back to town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When do we deliver, then?” asked Nabours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve sold and delivered right now and right here,
on the prairie,” replied Pattison. “I am hiring all the
men that will go in with Mr. McMasters and me; we’d
like at least six or eight. Mr. McMasters will come
out to help tally to-morrow if that suits you. I never
knew a Texas cowman to falsify a count, and I never
knew one that didn’t go broke trying to pack his own
cattle. It takes big men to do big business, and you
will have to pardon me if I say it never was in the
cards to pack cattle in Texas, by Texas or for Texas.
The South needs the North in this thing. It’s going
to take both the North and the South to make this
country out here.” He swept a wide arm. “The West!
Oh, by golly!”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” sighed Jim Nabours, still unable to credit
his sudden good fortune, “my boss is the richest girl in
Texas right now, if she was in Texas. I’ll have to
admit she owes part to a damn Yankee, same as part
to us Texans.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned earnestly to the Northern trader.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve got to see our boss when you get in town,”
said he. “You’ll be glad to see where all your money
went to. She shore is prettier than a spotted pup.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, let’s ride,” laughed Pattison. “We’ll have
a look at Abilene and the Texas orphan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On our way!” said Nabours, and they mounted.
Nabours rode off to accost one of his men. “We’ve
sold the herd, Len,” said he. “I’ll pay off to-morrow in
town. All you fellows that wants to hire out to these
folks can do it. You split the men to-night, Len, and
half of you come to town if you feel like it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes,” he added, turning, as he started off, “I
forgot to tell you. I forgot to tell you that Cal Dalhart
got killed in town a little while ago. I heard it just
when I left. Del Williams done shot him, looks like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The hell he did!” remarked Hersey. “Well, it was
plain enough the last three months they had it in for
each other—both allowing to marry Miss Taisie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now they won’t neither of them will,” nodded
Nabours. “Ain’t it hell how men fuss over a woman?
Now Del’s gone somewheres. Both good cow hands
as ever rid. That’s the fourth man I’ve lost since we
left home, not mentioning several hundred cows. I’m
the onluckiest man in the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet,” he went on as he joined McMasters and Pattison,
addressing the former, “I call this a good day’s
work. We’ve brung our brand through, and we’ve done
sold her out. I reckon Mr. Sim Rudabaugh has played
in hard luck. He didn’t keep us out of Aberlene, now
did he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He did his best,” replied Dan McMasters. “He
got here just a little too late. He came to town on the
train just a little while ago. There are two or three
of his men here already, maybe more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours looked at him narrowly, suddenly serious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some of us boys’ll be in town to-night,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they rode by the jumbled heap of the camp-cart
goods a very exact observer might have noted that the
pair of wide horns carefully cherished by Len Hersey
had disappeared since the first passing of the group
from town. No one had particularly noticed Len as he
rode up near the cart with a stubborn little yearling
dogy on his rope; it was thought the cook had requisitioned
beef. But now, as the party turned to leave
the herd, the keen eye of Pattison caught sight of an
astonishing creature, scarce larger than a calf, but
bearing so enormous a spread of horns as would have
graced any immemorial steer of the Rio Grande.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My Lord!” he exclaimed. “What on earth is that?
Is that the way cattle grow down in your country?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir,” replied Len gravely, still holding the
animal on his reata. “He’s a nice little yearling. Give
him time, an’ he’ll raise right smart o’ horn. O’ course,
he’s still young. Texas, she sort of runs to horn, in
some spots, special seems like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Spots? Spots? What spots?” demanded Pattison.
“Where’d that critter come from?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He come from our range, sir,” replied Len. “He
range over with a bunch near the Laguna Del Sol.
They all watered in there, at the Laguna. Near’s we
could tell there must be something in the water in the
Laguna sort of makes the cows in there run to horn,
like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I should say so! But still, you can’t make me
believe that any steer less than a four could ever grow
horns like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, they kin,” rejoined this artless child of the
range. “My pap used to drive down to Rockport, on
the coast—I’ve helped drive south, to ship cows on the
Plant steamers. I reckon they was going to Cuby.
We had to rope every steer and throw him down and
take a ax and chop off his horns, they was so wide.
That was to give more room on the boats. Some steers
didn’t like to have their horns chopped off thataway.
Well, here we got plenty of room for horns anyhow.”
He swept an arm over the field of waving grass reaching
on to the blue horizon. “Give me three years more
on this dogy and I promise you he’ll have horns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speaking of horns, Jim,” he resumed; “oncet when
we were driving in a coast drive we turned in a lot
of dogies, of course claimin’ a cow was a cow, an’
nache’l, four years old even if it was only a yearling.
Well, the damn Yankee who was buying our cows he
kicked on so many dogies. Of course, none of us
fellers’d ever heard of a thing like that; a buyer allus
taken the run o’ the delivery, head for head. Says
he, ‘I ain’t buyin’ yearlin’s, I’m buyin’ fours.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we driv in another dogy right then, one of
them Lagunies, an’ he had horns big as this one here.
The damn little fool he put on more airs than any
Uvalde mossy horn about his headworks. It was
just like he said, ‘Look at me! I done riz these here
horns in one year, where it taken you maybe a hunderd.’
Cows was their pride, mister, same as us. Uh-huh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But do you believe me? That damn Yankee
wouldn’t take my word that the horns of them Lagunies
gets their growth early sometimes. I says, ‘Mister, I’ll
bet you a hunderd dollars that’s a four.’ ‘Well, maybe
it is,’ says he. He scratch his haid. But he couldn’t
git over it. When we come to load in at the boat he
says, ‘Well I be damned ef that ain’t the littlest cow I
ever seen fer a four.’ I was sort o’ hot by then, and I
says, ‘Boss, you’re right—that ain’t a four, it’s a yearlin’.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then he swung around the other way. Says
he, ‘It kain’t noways be a yearlin’, not with them horns.
I bought too many cows not to know that much. It
don’t stand to reason that no yearlin’ can raise no horns
more’n five foot acrost.’ You see, mister, that yearlin’
was carryin’ horns about like this one—one of our
Lagunies. O’ course, I don’t say that all Texas cows
has horns like that as yearlin’s; you can see that fer yore
own self right here. Only way we could convince that
gentleman was to show him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that may all be,” said Pattison, nettled. “Anyhow,
I always take my own judgment in cattle, ages
and all. I’ve known buyers who couldn’t tell long
twos from threes. I’ve studied cattle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never did much,” said Len Hersey; “I never had
time. But my folks couldn’t never break me of gamblin’—monte,
you know. Sometimes I win a shirt, and
then agin I’d lose one. Right now”—he looked ruefully
at his elbow—“I’d like fer to win one. I’ll gamble that
critter’s a yearlin’, now. I’d hate to take a man’s
money on a cinch; but ef you, now, was feelin’ you’d
like to peel off a couple of hunderd against my hawse
an’ saddle, an’ what’s left of my shirt, why, I’d hate
to rob you—I’d bet that that’s a yearlin’. I was goin’
to kill it fer beef. We don’t eat the horns, mister, but
them Lagunies is special tender on account of that something
in the water around there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You fool Texans deserve to be trimmed,” said
Pattison; “a boy like you putting your judgment up
against that of one of the oldest buyers that ever saw
Kansas City.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it—I know I’m foolish,” nodded Len
Hersey. “I was borned thataway. I allus hatter be
bettin’ on monte er somethin’. Still I’ll bet thataway on
this here yearlin’ ef you insist. Does you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I certainly do, just to teach you a lesson. Here,
Mr. Nabours”—he pulled out his roll of bills once more—“take
this couple hundred, against this man’s horse
and saddle. You be the judge. He bets that’s a yearling.
That suit you?” He turned to Len Hersey,
who still was holding the mooted animal on his reata.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, all right,” humbly replied that youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Throw him, Len,” commanded Nabours; “then
we’ll all look him over and decide.” He was as solemn
as his man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Len sunk a spur and with a leap his pony crossed
in front of the quarry, swept its feet from under it. It
was thrown with such violence that one of its horns was
knocked off and lay entirely free on the grass. Jim
Nabours, dismounting, gravely held up the remaining
horn, easily detachable from the normal stubby yearling
growth on the dogy’s head. He looked at Pattison
dubiously, none too sure how he would take this range
jest. But the Northern man was a sportsman. He
broke into a roar of laughter, which for hours he
renewed whenever the thought again came to his mind.<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give him his money, Nabours,” said he. “He’s
won it fair and I’ve had a lesson, and when your boys
come to town the treat’s on me. Keep those horns for
me,” he added. “If I don’t sell old Mitch or young
Phil Armour at Kansas City with those horns I’ll
eat them both!” Again he went off into gusty laughter,
in which all could join.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sho, now,” said Len Hersey. “Now look at that!
He must of got his horns jarred loose, like, in some
night run in the timber. I’ve knowed that to happen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Len,” commanded Nabours, “I don’t want no more
of this damned foolishness. Here’s ten dollars, and
that’s enough to buy you a shirt, and I want to see you
do it. He’ll only play the rest at monte or faro or something,”
turning to Pattison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, give it all to him,” the latter rejoined. “It’s
his. Let him play it. I’ve done as much myself when
I was younger. And monte’s a cinch compared to buying
and packing and shipping cattle to the East.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They turned and rode toward town, young in the
youth of the open range, where to-morrow did not yet
loom.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>“C</span></span>OME right on in, you poor child.” When Taisie
Lockhart first had climbed down from the
lofty cart seat and approached the front door
of the Drovers’ Cottage, she walked straight into the
arms of sturdy Lou Gore, matron of the first cowman’s
hotel of the North and Florence Nightingale of the
frontier. That good soul took the girl to her bosom,
patting her shoulder like a mother. “My!” she exclaimed.
“To think at first I might have took you
for a boy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they entered the door she felt her young charge
wince, draw back. A tall young man stood in the office
near the door. It seemed to Lou Gore that these two
must somewhere have met, although she scarce heard
the voice of either now as they saluted, acknowledged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, you knew that gentleman?” she asked
later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Taisie; “he was once a neighbor of ours
down in Texas. He was with us part way on the
trail.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh-ho! Well, he don’t seem so very neighborly
now, up here. He don’t talk to nobody except Wild
Bill. Them two were shooting at a mark over on the
street. My husband says neither of them didn’t miss.
My dear, don’t never have anything to do with a man
who is a shooter—take my advice. Men is bad, and
shooters is worst.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But now you come on in with me, child; I’ve got
to take care of you. Law me, is this all the clothes
you got—and this the Fourth of July?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes”—Taisie turned on her the gaze of her troubled
eyes—“it’s all I’ve got. I am poor—unless we sell the
cows. In Texas no one has anything but cows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you ain’t poor if them’s your cows. You’ll
sell ’em all right. Everybody’s howling for cattle
right now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But come back into my kitchen, my dear, and I’ll
fix you up. Who is that hollering out in front?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that’s Milly, my black woman,” said Taisie.
“She’s out in the cart. Wait, I’ll go get her.” And
presently she returned with Milly, in one hand carrying
her long-barreled weapon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Taisie, Ah cross my ha’ht,” said she. “Ah’m
sho’ Ah done seen dat no-’count nigger man o’ mine
right down the street. If he ever do come a leetle bit
closter I gwine to blow the lights outen him. Ah sho’
is!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Law sakes!” remarked Lou Gore. “How you talk!
Set that gun down and come on and help me get this
lady fixed up. If I only had a change of clothes for
her,” she added, finger at lip, dubiously regarding
Taisie’s male apparel. “We don’t fit each other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Change of clothes, ma’am!” exclaimed Milly. “In
her trunk out in the kyart she got all kind of clothes!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My mother’s wedding clothes!” Taisie smiled sadly.
“I brought them along because I had no place to leave
them. My own are all worn out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that’s all right, my dear. We got to fix you
up a little first, you’re so dusty. I reckon my big dishpan
will do. You’d think they’d have washtubs over
at the store, but they haven’t; not one. There ain’t a
bathtub in the whole state of Kansas, and never was.
Plenty of shooting, but mighty little washing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She pushed Taisie down into a kitchen chair and
tenderly removed her broad-brimmed hat. Thus was
revealed the heavy queue of hair that lay down the girl’s
neck and shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you ever!” exclaimed Lou Gore. “Lemme cut
that string off.” Her scissors were at her belt; a snip
or two, a shake, a running through of her fingers, and
the glorious flood of Anastasie Lockhart’s tresses fell
about her as she sat, a Godiva in a cotton shirt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going to take off that shirt, my dear,” said Lou
Gore, and leaned Taisie’s head against her own bosom.
She caught the garment by the lower edge and left the
girl sitting, tousled, her arms now huddled to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My Lord, my dear,” exclaimed Lou Gore, “you’re
a beauty! You don’t belong here. And wedding
clothes? You say you’ve got wedding clothes out in
the cart? You’ll need them. Look at that hair! My
dear, how do you make it curl up on the end that way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Milly who explained: “It just quoil up on de
fur end dat way nacherl. She got more hair den ary
lady in Texas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lou Gore stood back and looked at Taisie once
more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear,” said she, “you are a beauty! What’s
more, you are good. Give me a hour or two with you
fixed up in woman clothes and I’ll marry you to any
man you’ll point out to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In her trunk, I done told you,” interrupted Milly,
“she got all kind o’ clothes; all silk—pink an’ blue
an’ everything. Her maw had the pertiest clothes in
Texas. She brung her clothes out from N’Awlins.
You-all knows quality, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lou Gore pursed a lip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we’ll get the trunk in,” said she. “Now,
child, you go into my room there and lay down until
I get the water het. You’re that nervous, you jump
when you see a young man standing around.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taisie Lockhart, clinging to Lou Gore’s hand, flung
herself upon the white bed, the flame of her hair all
about her shoulders, concealing her face. She began to
sob indeed, utterly unnerved. Lou Gore understood
this to be the fatigue of a thousand miles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She must have slept. It seemed hours later that she
was awakened by what seemed to be the sound of a door
slammed shut. A few moments later came the sudden
sound of a horse galloping. That was Del Williams,
passing out of town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lou Gore heard the arrival of the railway train,
saw men passing from the train. When she met
Hickok and McMasters at the foot of the stair they
told her what she would see if she went upstairs. But
to the sturdy soul of Lou Gore hysterics were unknown.
She did go upstairs, did make a certain discovery, did
perform certain offices for the first man in Abilene
to pass with his boots on. Then, whether in care of
Abilene’s reputation or out of kindness for her sleeping
guest, she did not open the door of Taisie’s room
to tell her what had happened. Well, a man was dead.
There would be others. Lou Gore sighed, her great
hands wrapped in her apron.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Milly,” said she at length to the black woman, whom
she found in the kitchen, “you come help me get supper.
It takes an awful lot of fried mush. And these men
keep coming here, though I ain’t got this hotel really
opened yet.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>When the party from the herd jogged into town the
first man they met was McCoyne, and now he had
news of his own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wild Bill told me about the little trouble upstairs.”
He nodded toward the Drovers’ Cottage. “One man
seems to have left town. I didn’t want anybody to
think we’ve got a tough town here. Fact is we haven’t
got any courthouse or coroner or anything. We’ve
got to hold an organization meeting and get these things
fixed up before long. I just got a couple of men
that was standing out near the door to go over and dig
a good grave on the hill yonder; you can see it from
here. First grave in Abilene, July 4, 1867. Well, Mr.
Nabours, they buried your man fine; they fixed up some
sort of a box for a coffin. I seen them two carry him
over to the hill all right. I declare, I don’t believe there
is a coffin in this whole town—our storekeepers is that
negligent, got that poor a notion of goods. Now think
of my getting so busy, forgetting to have our merchants
order plenty of coffins! I don’t want Abilene to be back
of no town in Kansas. You understand, in the hurry
of getting things started, gentlemen, a man’s liable to
overlook a lot of things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They informed McCoyne of the sale of the Del Sol
herd. He shook each by the hand effusively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t I tell you”—to Nabours—“didn’t I say you’d
find buyers up here in Abilene? Sold out, the first day
you hit town! Sold out at twenty straight right
through! More money than you ever seen before!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That ain’t no dream,” said Jim Nabours, taking a
chew of tobacco. “Say, Mr. Pattison, you couldn’t
raise some silver money, could you? This paper money
is all right, of course; and if Dan McMasters says so,
that paper on the bank is all right and it goes too.
But silver is the only money that’s money in Texas. I
don’t reckon my men would take any other kind, and I
know old Sanchez wouldn’t. You can’t pay no Mexican
nothing but silver.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t need very much money,” smiled McMasters.
“But, Jim, did you ever stop to figure how much
money you’d have if you got it all in silver?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, no, I don’t reckon I ever did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, a thousand dollars in silver weighs about
sixty-three pounds—somewhere in there. Now, sixty
times sixty is thirty-six hundred, isn’t it? You’d have
pretty near two tons of money. You’d have to load a
cart to get it home. If the Comanches didn’t get it,
it’d sink any wagon you tried to ford.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My Lord!” said Jim Nabours. “My good Lord!
Look what we escaped, coming North! Tell me, has
Miss Taisie got that much money now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She certainly has if she gets it all in silver,” smiled
Pattison. “You begin to see what banks are good for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By gum!” exclaimed McCoyne, slapping his thigh.
“We certainly have got to have a bank in Abilene, right
off! Anyhow, for looks we’ve got to have a church and
a school; but a bank is almost as useful as a livery
barn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll see what can be done about that when I get
back to Kansas City,” said Pattison. “I’d not be surprised
to see a million cattle come up the trail in the next
two seasons. Think of the silver it would take to pay
for them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mister,” said Jim Nabours, in a very genuine mental
distress, “how much silver money would a million cows
come to at twenty straight—I mean how many
pounds?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So much that pretty soon we’ll have to have banks
at both ends of the Texas trail,” said Pattison quietly.
“So much that before long we’ll have to have railroads
north and south instead of trails. So much that before
long there’ll be a dozen towns instead of one handling
the cattle coming North. So much that all this country
north and west of here is going to be settled with
people—farms, towns, railroads. Trail makers? The
first trail maker of the world was a cow!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He dropped his chin for an instant in thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the men who’ll be in on that,” he added presently,
“are the ones who can see it now and not after a
while. My new partner and I can see it now. We
traded quick. I always trade fast or not at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nabours still remained uneasy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got five thousand paper dollars in my saddle
pockets,” said he. “Where’s Miss Taisie at? I want
to pay off the men. They’ll be wanting a little frolic.
Won’t you come along and find her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at Dan McMasters keenly, a little sadly.
But though McMasters directed him to the Drovers’
Cottage, he excused himself. For this reason not even
cheery Lou Gore could make Taisie Lockhart smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McMasters went after Wild Bill, whom he found,
hands in pockets, watching a faro game.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve watched your men,” said Hickok, quietly getting
McMasters to one side. “There are three or four
of them. They don’t show any signs of leaving town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The herd men are coming to town to-night,” said
McMasters. “If we want help I can get it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The border man stroked his long yellow mustache.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You and I wouldn’t need any help if we didn’t need
any of them alive,” said he. “I’m going to sit in with
you on this, because you can hold up your end. We can
stick around for a while. Of course, your man Rudabaugh
knows you are here. He’s got horses over at
the Twin Livery Barn; I know that much. He may
pull his freight any minute. Or he may be laying for
a chance to plug you from around a corner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McMasters nodded quietly. Hickok went on: “Well,
they didn’t keep your herd from coming through, did
they? What price do you think your cattle will fetch?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re already sold,” said Dan McMasters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave the details of the late transaction, including
his own arrangement with Pattison for a northern-ranch
venture. Hickok listened indifferently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad you took my advice,” said he. “That’s
all out of my line. I only keep the peace. Looks like
before long there’d be plenty of peace to keep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that girl in the boy’s clothes is rich, eh? Well,
I’m glad, aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No one is gladder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is she now? She’s vanished. Has she heard
of the sale?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not yet. Her foreman has just gone over to tell
her. I think Lou Gore has been taking care of her.
No, she doesn’t know yet that she’s rich.”</p>

the door of the Drovers’ Cottage, near which he
found a man tinkling a steel triangle, which one
day soon would boom a summons thrice a day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How are you, sir?” began Nabours. “Can you tell
me if Miss Taisie Lockhart is in here? She come up
on that herd with us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The husband of Lou Gore indicated the rear of the
building. Unannounced, Nabours pushed on through
the rear hall, beyond whose door he heard sounds of
culinary conflict.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Law, mister, ain’t you in a sort of hurry?” said
Lou Gore, a large spoon in one hand. “This is the
kitchen. You go on out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I want to see my boss,” remonstrated the old
foreman. “I’ve got five thousand dollars in my shirt
for her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lou Gore wiped her hands on her apron.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said she, “if you’ve got five thousand dollars
come on in. I’ll let you see her if I can.” She approached
the bedroom door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jim! Jim!” called a voice he knew very well, a voice
full of eagerness now. The door flung open. Taisie,
shrouded in blankets, broke out, her radiant face framed
in its mass of glowing hair. She flung an arm about
the grizzled foreman’s neck. He seemed almost the
one friend in all the world for her. “I’m so glad you’ve
come!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Taisie,” said Jim Nabours succinctly, “here is
five thousand dollars. I reckon you’d better put on your
pants—if you got nothing else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Taisie sank into a chair, enveloping herself in her
blankets. Her eyes were startled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Five thousand dollars?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, ma’am. I done sold the cows at twenty
straight. There’ll be about three thousand head. That’s
sixty thousand dollars, ma’am. This here, now, is only
part of it. It’ll be in and around sixty thousand. We
can get the rest any time we want. I reckon we done
right well for you, Miss Taisie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taisie Lockhart looked up at him with sudden tears
in her eyes, weak in the reaction from the strain of
years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could kiss you, Jim!” said she.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you wouldn’t, ma’am; not until I get shaved.
Yes, ma’am, we done right well, all things considered.
Now, I think you better get about five thousand worth
of more clothes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s got all the clothes she needs, she told me,”
remarked Lou Gore; “a whole trunk of clothes out
there on the cart. We haven’t had time to fetch it in
yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, shore she has, ma’am! We brung that trunk
all the way from Texas. You can’t ride a cow horse in
them kind of clothes, ma’am. So Lord Lovel he
mounted his milk-white steed. Ain’t she pretty,
ma’am? Prettier’n any spotted pup ever was!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But say, Miss Taisie,” he went on to the girl who
still sat huddled in her blankets, “I got to tell you all
the news. Dan McMasters has throwed in with the
man we sold our cows to. They’re going to start a
ranch up North here. We-all are a-goin’ to drive cows
up to their ranch next year. Dan, he’s a partner in
that; he’s going to be plumb rich. I heard him say
he was going to leave Texas, him sher’f and all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Far as that goes, if it hadn’t of been for Dan, we
maybe wouldn’t have traded. He bid up for all the
light stuff, at the same price the other man offered for
fours—twenty straight through. Now, Dan——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For mercy sake, man, how you run on!” broke in
Lou Gore. “You go help this black woman to bring in
that trunk from the cart. This is the Fourth of July,
and we may have some sort of dance here if them band
people ain’t too drunk. Go fetch that trunk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, all right, all right,” said Jim Nabours. “I
was just trying to tell the boss a few things she’d orter
know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in three minutes Jim Nabours was back in the
room, gray under his grime and tan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Taisie,” said he dully, “your trunk’s gone! It
ain’t in the cart at all. The scrip in there was worth
maybe five times as much as sixty thousand dollars.
Lands’ll go up in Texas now. And here I’ve lost all the
scrip that yore paw give you!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Taisie, it was all my fault. I never did once
think of that trunk a-tall; I was only thinking of cows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Jim, who could have taken it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” said Jim Nabours. “It’s gone oncet
more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stumbled into a chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon I’m too old now. I’ve let you get robbed
oncet more.”</p>

Abilene. The night chill came, the
quavering wail of the coyotes crept closer to
the outskirts of the town, the unbelievably brilliant stars
came out to illuminate a many-splendored night. But to
these things Abilene paid little heed. She held festival
on her day of triumph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fumes of liquor, the reek of packed humanity
filled each insignificant room along Liquor Lane in
Abilene. Especially crowded were the two more ambitious
places, where dancing was obtainable in connection
with strong drink. Here the scene was such as might
best be forgotten as a part of the record of the outlands.
There were a dozen or more women, or those who once
had been women; and with these, in an obscenity that
should balk any pen, a hundred or two hundred men
danced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A general confusion, many voices arising continuously,
passed out of the open windows and open doors.
The stamp of feet, shoutings, senseless laughter, shrill
hysteria of females excited by drink, the coarser basso
of males excited likewise, joined in a curious roar whose
sensuous undertone resembled no other sound or blend
of sounds in all the world. In no corner of the world
have the primitive instincts of man found fuller loosing
than in the border capitals of the cow trails.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the etiquette—unvarying in Saxon outlands—that
he who danced with a damsel must lead her to the
bar after they twain had trod a measure, else lack in a
decent respect for the opinion of mankind. Of actual
sets, of any measured cæsura, there was none. The
music was furnished by rum-soaked men who sat apart
on barrels, the same who had welcomed that morning
the first Texas herd ever seen in Abilene. Such as it
was, and supported by fiery stimulant, the concord was
continuous, the floors were always full. Men danced
in hats and boots and spurs. The voice of a submerged
set caller droned on: “Dolcie do! Allemand left!
Swing your partner! Lift her high!” It was festival
in Abilene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McMasters and Wild Bill Hickok passed from door
to door, the quietest and soberest men in all the town.
There approached them a man in uniform, a sergeant
of the United States Army. He recognized McMasters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been looking for you, sir,” said he. “I am up
from the Wichita Mountains, from Colonel Griswold.
I’ve got two ambulances and an escort of five men for
each. I was to offer you any help you required, sir,
and to put the ambulances under your order if any of
your people wished to travel south. The colonel could
not come. He sends his compliments and hopes you
are quite well. He thinks it would be much safer for
you to travel south across the Nations under military
escort. He hopes the young lady will occupy one ambulance
for her own in case you sell out, and start south,
sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, sergeant,” replied McMasters; “that’s
very fine of Colonel Griswold. The young lady has
sold her herd to-day and will be starting south before
long. Where are your ambulances and your men?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sergeant grinned, somewhat embarrassed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The ambulances are at the Twin Star Barn,” said
he. “I put my mules and horses in there too. I guess
my men may be scattered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop your drinking,” said Dan McMasters. “You
may be needed to-night. Go get your men together.
Be at the Silver Moon half an hour from now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very good, sir,” said the man, and saluted again.
He cast a longing eye through windows as he passed
down the street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Near the door of the Silver Moon Dance Hall a man
pushed by them, anxious; Nabours, looking around
him, not hurrying to the bar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dan!” he exclaimed as he caught sight of McMasters.
His granite agitation, his naïve disregard of all
the post, bridged any gap remaining between them.
“Look here! Hell’s to pay!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s up?” asked McMasters, startled by the look
on his face. “Anything gone wrong with—her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes! Miss Taisie’s trunk is gone; it’s been stole
out of the cart right in front of the door. All her scrip
was in it—you know what.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sudden flush came to Dan McMaster’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are rather a fine foreman, aren’t you, Jim?”
said he. “Was that the best you could use that girl?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Call me anything you like. I’m a damned old fool.
I’ve quit her hire. I gave her the money and quit
her hire right here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you know that Sim Rudabaugh and some of
his gang are in town right now? They’ve beat us, after
all; they’ve got the scrip, even if they couldn’t stop the
herd. Rudabaugh can get his lands now in spite of you
and me. He’ll own all the state of Texas, west of the
Double Mountain Fork. He’ll get what Miss Lockhart’s
father left her, her fortune in lands. We have
been making money for him, not her! You let that
thing happen right now, when I have almost got my
hand on his collar!” He spoke with greater bitterness
than any man had ever known of him. At length the
indomitable side of his nature took sway again. “But
we’ll comb out the town first. Go get McCoyne.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They did get McCoyne, and solicited his aid in such
general search for the missing treasure chest as they
hurriedly could contrive. It all was hopeless. No one
had seen two men carrying a trunk. The cart was
precisely where it had been left. No vehicle had left
town, no train. The Del Sol treasure trunk simply had
disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The allies, discomfited, met at last in the open street,
Hickok having joined them by this time, and having
heard the story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hark!” said the latter, raising a hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His keen ears had caught the sound which presently
became obvious to them all—the pounding of hoofs,
yelling of riders in concert. Sweeping over the prairies
at top speed, the herdsmen of Del Sol were coming in
to have their share in the Fourth of July celebration.
But as they stood looking to the north there came the
sound of a heavy rifle shot, close at hand. A red streak
came from the window near the kitchen of the Cottage.
Two men came running. On general principles Hickok
halted them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was that shot?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That?” panted one of the runners. “That old negro
woman. She got scared and shot through the window.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But by now Hickok thought he had recognized the
speaker as one of the men he had seen talking with
Rudabaugh earlier in the day. The two fugitives turned
into the door of the Silver Moon Dance Hall just before
the Del Sol riders swept up and cast down their bridle
reins. All the overflow population of Abilene seemed
to be packed into or on one side or other of the door of
the Silver Moon. Hickok, Nabours, McMasters pushed
in through the crowd hard after the Del Sol men,
unkempt, ragged, wild, troubled with no false modesty
as to their own place in the world. They pushed on up
to the bar, Len Hersey leading them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, men!” called the high voice of that lusty
youth. “I got enough dinero for one little time, and
I’m going to have more. Set ’em up, mister, and do it
quick. You come in here, Sanchez—come on, Sinker!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then pushed forward from among them the thin
figure of a boy, ragged, unshorn, his hair through his
hat, his lower extremities pushed through a pair of
leather leggings a world too large for him. It was
Cinquo’s first appearance at a public bar, part of his
education for his calling. At his shoulder was the
thin figure of a dark man, old, grizzled, imperturbable—Sanchez,
the only Mexican on the Del Sol herd.
Unsmilingly Sanchez drew from under his coat the
object which had had a place on his saddle horn. He
set down upon the bar a much bedraggled, entirely
dilapidated gamecock—nothing less than Gallina, whom
he had cherished for a thousand miles. And Gallina
now repaid him. He cast a red eye over the multitude
and bade defiance to the world in a long and lusty
crow. A peal of laughter broke from the crowd.
Again the voice of Len Hersey arose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This here rooster can lick ary chicken in the state of
Kansas, five hunderd a battle. This here boy and his
horse can outrun ary outfit in this town, ary distance,
for five hunderd a race. I can whip ary man in this
here room myself. We’re just from Texas and we’re
wild and woolly. Our steers has longer horns than
anybody’s. Del Sol has came to town!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The not ill-natured rioters crowded about him and his
fellows, accosting him partly in jest and partly in
earnest. The Del Sol orator leaned against the bar and
faced them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, men!” said Hersey, sweeping a wide arm.
“Here goes all the money I’ve got—couple of hunderd!
Say, mister, is our credit good when that runs out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There ain’t no man’s credit good here when his
money runs out,” replied the barman sullenly. “Take
that hen off my bar. Go ask your owner that dresses
in pants why she hasn’t paid off her men earlier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sort of squealing yell arose above the tumult. The
boy Cinquo had wheeled like a flash, his heavy revolver
in hand. His sweeping blow struck the bartender on
the top of the head and dropped him motionless as a log.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t say her name in no saloon!” shrilled the
boy. “That’s no way to treat us folks from Texas.
If there’s any of you-all looking for trouble you can
git it right here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what you can!” cried Len Hersey, touching
elbows. The men of Del Sol edged close together.
“Take a drink, Sinker—we’ll owe it to this house if
you haven’t got no money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy reached out his hand, thin, freckled, unwavering,
toward the bottle which stood near. It was
his first drink at a bar. Well, he had to begin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You hear me!” again called out Len Hersey. “This
kid gits his drink free right now. We bar any talk
against our boss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But a tall figure pushed through the crowd directly
up to Hersey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, my friend,” said Wild Bill Hickok, “I
know who you are and it’s all right, but you’re making
too much noise. Just keep quiet now. Son, you don’t
get any drink—it wouldn’t do you any good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He reached out and took the glass which Cinquo
Centavos had filled for himself. Whether or not even
Wild Bill could have done so much as this without
trouble happily did not come into question. McMasters,
Nabours, now appeared at his side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shut your mouth, Len,” said Nabours. “Somebody’s
liable to fill you full of holes. You know mighty
well we’ve got to trail the bulk of the herd to-morrow
over to the Smoky Hill and Junction City. Take a
drink or so, and then keep your hand off the liquor
till you get done your work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one seemed to pay any attention to the prone
figure of the barkeeper, who lay on the floor beyond
the bar. A sort of hush in the maudlin manifestations
came upon the closely packed assemblage at the sight
of the unmistakable figure of Wild Bill, whose reputation
was known over all the borderlands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was in this hush, at this dead center, that there
came a sudden flash and roar from the back of the
crowded hall. Dan McMasters, turning to look over
the bar at the fallen man, felt a sudden flick at the collar
of his coat. A bottle on the shelf beyond crashed to
bits. A lamp toward the rear of the hall went out under
the concussion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McMasters wheeled, both weapons in hand, looking
out over the surging mass of men and women. He was
just a second later than the future marshal of Abilene,
who had not turned. The tall figure of Hickok straightened
like a flash to his full height. His arm rose high,
pointing a red line of flame. At the rear of the room a
man dropped. He had been shot squarely through the
forehead, the bullet passing just above the heads of the
others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What happened then no man knew. There was a
mad rush towards the door. Women screamed and
sought to escape by the windows. A score of guns
were drawn. No man knew where stood his enemy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Midway of the mad rush in the rear of the room three
men came crouching, crowding, each with a gun in
his hand. They endeavored to keep together; and thus,
being recognized as a source of danger, certain of the
crowd pushed away from them, left them more readily
visible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let them out!” The command came high and clear.
McMasters laid a hand on Hickok’s arm. “Let them
get out on the street!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had recognized, as one of the three men, the man
he had come so far to meet—his arch enemy Rudabaugh.
But he did not fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hickok stayed his hand. He did not look toward
the rear of the room, now cleared, for he knew his work
there was done. He never was known to look at the
effect of any shot he ever made; he always knew. There
stood now at his side a man as dangerous as himself.
But the two best pistol men on all that wild border now
dared not shoot, had they so desired, for the men had
shrugged down below the level of the crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s Rudabaugh in front!” called McMasters.
“Don’t shoot him! Let him alone! Let him get out!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He himself began to edge toward the door, Wild Bill
pushing through the crowd at his elbow. The Del Sol
men for the time were jostled back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Rudabaugh who had sought to end at any cost
the life of his worst enemy, Dan McMasters. He had
missed, across the room, but now intended to kill
McMasters at short range. But always some other man
intervened, caught down his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made a sudden last plan—often a deadly one—stepped
outside the door and waited for his man to
follow—an old border trick which very often worked.
The shooter would be in the darkness, his target in the
light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the wily bandit leader had reckoned ill with the
men he now was meeting. Even as he passed over the
threshold Hickok suddenly fired over McMasters’
shoulder. His bullet struck the barrel of Rudabaugh’s
revolver and hurled it from his hand. An instant later
the two officers broke out the door. Rudabaugh, wringing
his hand, was stooping for his revolver, his two
companions making off at top speed in the moonlight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for the latter, they both fell face forward, shot
through the back. Neither of their two executioners
had time to look at them. Both covered Rudabaugh as
he half rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t shoot!” cried McMasters once more. “Leave
him to me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An instant later and he was locked in grips with the
ruffian he had sought so long to meet in precisely this
fashion. Hickok stood back, his elbows at the door
jamb, a revolver in either hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Easy, gentlemen!” said he. “Easy now! Don’t
come out! Just stay right where you are!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every man who heard heeded the advice of Wild
Bill and set back his shoulders against the thrust behind
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The combat on the beaten ground in front of the
Silver Moon did not long endure. McMasters had
borne down his man at the first leap. Rudabaugh’s
right hand was still numb from the impact of the ball
which had struck his weapon. Moreover, he was much
older than his antagonist, soft with drink and excess
of every imaginable sort, little more than the shell of a
man; whereas his enemy was young, sound, hard and
lithe as a panther. One fought a battle with the result
foreordained, the other sought to postpone the end.
McMasters was absolutely merciless when finally he
twisted Rudabaugh’s arm behind him and flung him
face down on the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Handcuffs were unknown in that land. McMasters
pushed his knees up under Rudabaugh’s elbows, gripped
his hands together and twisted a silk handkerchief
around them, tying it into a knot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He kicked Rudabaugh into obedience, caught him by
the collar when he stood, hated him so bitterly that he
was much of the mind to shoot him even now. But
at length his calmness came back to him as Hickok
approached once more, McCoyne also pushing forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where am I going to keep this man?” demanded
McMasters. It was McCoyne who answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gentlemen,” said he, “I certainly apologize. I might
have known we’d need a jail, but I’ve been so busy I
haven’t had time to fix up a lot of things. Give me a
day or so, and I’ll show you that Abilene has got the
best jail in Kansas. I’ve been so busy——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wild Bill turned back to Len Hersey, who now had
got out at the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go get your rope and help this officer,” said he.
“Now go home, all of you.” He turned toward the
crowd. “You’ve had enough to drink and you’ve got
enough Fourth of July for one day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He grinned as he turned once more toward McMasters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you should happen to take your friend out of
town,” said he, “I don’t see how I could help myself.
There don’t seem to be any courts here, or any place
to hold a prisoner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rudabaugh broke out in blasphemy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You damned outlaws, you cutthroats!” he began.
“You can’t take me without any warrant, and you can’t
hold me without process of law. I demand counsel.
I’m going to have my trial. Is this America, I want to
know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said it,” remarked Bill Hickok. “That’s just
what it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now came running the men of the military escort.
McMasters addressed the sergeant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Help me get this man over to the livery barn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They led Rudabaugh away. He was cursing, struggling,
sobbing. Wild Bill stood looking after them,
with no apparent concern. He evinced no interest in
the victims of the night affray. He had known worse
scenes of violence all his life, been in many encounters
of greater danger. To him these matters were much
in the day’s work sometimes, always tempered with the
killer’s fatalism, which valued nothing save the fact
that he found himself still alive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Joe,” said he, turning to McCoyne, who stood
near, “it seems like the law of habeas corpus hasn’t got
quite as far west as the Twin Livery Barn. If it has
I’ll suspend habeas corpus in this town until Captain
McMasters gets his prisoner out of town and headed
south.”</p>

Gore’s little room, Taisie Lockhart for once in
her life was now almost in a condition of hysteria.
The strain and stress of the long trail journey, the
anxiety of her hazard of fortunes, the relaxation of
success—and now all these scenes and sounds of violence
in combination so worked upon her worn nerves
that she no longer was herself. Lou Gore was much
put to it to comfort her, and, indeed, was glad enough
to welcome Jim Nabours and the boy Cinquo, who
later in the evening came in to tell the news of the
affair at the Silver Moon. These two paused in the
outer room, not daring to ask once more to see their
mistress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You tell her, ma’am,” said Jim Nabours. “Tell her
we got Rudabaugh safe and his gang busted wide open—three
of them killed. Dan McMasters, he taken
Rudabaugh prisoner hisself in a fair stand-up fight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, all right, all right,” responded Lou Gore;
“I’ll tell her anything. Nobody in town has had any
supper yet. We can’t have no dance now. This is the
beatingest Fourth of July ever I did see. I declare,
you cowboys give me more trouble than my gamblers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to be nasty to you,” she went on.
“But you’ve got to keep out of my kitchen. Here, take
a couple of keys and go on upstairs and go to bed. I
declare, I am right tired my own self.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meekly obedient, although reluctant not to see the
mistress of Del Sol before he slept, Jim Nabours
clumsily climbed the stairs, the boy close at his heels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s wrong, Mister Jim?” asked Cinquo solicitously.
“Ain’t we sold out all right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said his foreman gruffly. “We’ve won out
on the cows. But we’ve lost out on the land. You
know that trunk?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shore. I do. It was always getting in the road
everywheres.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It won’t be no more! It’s gone—lost—stole. It
was worth ten times as much as all our cows. Old
Rudabaugh knows where it is, but he ain’t so apt to
tell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he spoke he flung open the door of a room, one of
many precisely alike on either side of the upper hall.
But he paused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello!” said he. “There’s some one in here now,
and he’s gone to bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bed indeed was occupied—occupied by a long
and motionless figure, a pillow slip drawn across his
face, the hands folded on the breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be——” Jim Nabours halted as something
caught his eye. He stepped forward, drew back the
face covering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, it’s Cal Dalhart!” said he. “He’s dead all
right—but they done told me he was buried! McCoyne
told me he seen it done hisself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy came and stared down in awe at the long and
motionless figure, the white face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Him and Del, now——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Nabours took him by the arm. The two went
down the stairs once more into the office room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mister,” said Nabours to the gloomy occupant,
handing over his key, “you’d better give me another
room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter with the one you’ve got?” demanded
the landlord of the Drovers’ Cottage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Somebody in it now,” replied Nabours, “and he’s
dead. They told me that you-all got a couple of men
to bury that man that got shot. Is that right? It was
Mr. McCoyne told me that. Where is he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sounds of voices came through the open door. A
group of men were talking excitedly in the moonlight.
The landlord summoned in one of these—McCoyne,
ubiquitous and sleepless. To him Nabours repeated his
query.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly, sir,” replied McCoyne. “I saw the two
men carrying the coffin between them. I saw them bury
him as plain as I ever saw anything in all my life! Of
course, I wasn’t right out there with them. I been so
busy——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he ain’t buried now,” said Jim Nabours.
“Cal Dalhart’s up there, upstairs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t that beat anything you ever heard!” exclaimed
McCoyne. “It seems like everything goes wrong unless
a man does it his own self, don’t it now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You come along with me,” said Nabours, moved by
a sudden thought of his own. “You get two men—new
ones. I believe them two folks that buried Cal Dalhart
is both dead theirselfs. Bring a couple of shovels.
Hurry up!”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>A little group of men departed in the moonlight on a
certain gruesome errand. It was Jim Nabours himself
who began at the loose dirt of the mound at whose head
there had been erected a little headboard: “C. Dalhart,
of Texas. Died July 4, 1867. May he rest in peace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He couldn’t never rest in peace thisaway,” said
Jim Nabours a half hour later. His shovel struck something
hard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here, lend us a hand,” said he. “Sinker, get hold
the other handle of this trunk. It’s heavy. Huh! It’s
got a half million acres of Texas land into it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And we’ve got Sim Rudabaugh over in the livery
stable,” he added after a time thoughtfully, wiping the
perspiration from his forehead. “This ain’t no bad
day’s work a-tall. You people go on back and bring
Cal over here and we’ll bury him right. A fair exchange
ain’t no robbery.”</p>

began to scatter. No one knew when
another herd would come, if ever. The great
Del Sol herd now was split up, a portion coming into
the yards to try for an Eastern market, a greater portion
driven east to the crude packing plant at Junction City.
The remainder, under Len Hersey and a half dozen of
the best men of the Del Sol herd, was driven north to
the new range on the Smoky Hill. All the details of
Abilene’s first transaction in cows now were closed.
The bill of sale, the record of the tally, the passing of
the final bank draft—all details soon to become familiar
in the northern-range towns—now were completed.
The Del Sol horse band was sold north. Remained
only the two carts, each with its double yoke of oxen,
and two horses each for eight of the hands who had
concluded to return to Texas. The two Army ambulances
offered transport for the remainder of those who
had come north in the saddle. Taisie’s horse, Blancocito,
was left to trot alongside, unsaddled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lou Gore kissed Taisie Lockhart for the last time,
tears in the eyes of both; then wiped her hands and eyes
upon her apron and turned back to build up her reputation
as the biggest-hearted woman on the Plains.
What friend she was to the wild men of the trail,
countless wounded, crippled, ill and helpless cowmen
learned in the years to come; years of swift changes
on the upper range. A good soul, a strong heart of
the frontier, she left a beloved and covetable memory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ambulances, each drawn by four sleek mules,
stood in the street waiting, flanked by stalwart troopers.
In the foremost vehicle, on a middle seat, hidden from
view, sat Sim Rudabaugh, and gyves were on his wrists.
Thongs of rawhide, right and left, bound his hands to
the seat ends. Other thongs fastened his ankles and
passed back under the seat to a cross pole. In the seat
behind sat Dan McMasters and the boy Cinquo, both
armed. Rudabaugh could never have escaped. The
ruthless trail bandit, who never took a prisoner, himself
was a prisoner at last. To all his sobbings, his expostulations,
his execrations and his questions, no one made
any answer. Of friends he had none in all the world.
He was at the end of the trail of the transgressor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This ambulance, of course, must drive faster than
the others, which would hold back with the Del Sol
carts. In the second ambulance, well escorted, Taisie
was to ride with her foreman, Nabours. In this was
stowed a certain trunk covered with rawhide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as this little cavalcade stood halted in midstreet
of the cloudless morning, most of the remaining men
of Abilene came clamoring for the privilege of one
more farewell to the Texas girl. Taisie leaned forward
to greet them as they came, herself beautiful as the
dawn, in spite of the new droop at the corners of her
mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dan McMasters had said his own good-bys briefly,
coldly—the coldest man in all the world, she thought.
He never once had met her for a moment alone. Of
that swift brief fire of two earlier times only ashes
remained, unblown of any gust of passion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McCoyne flitted from one vehicle to the other, excitedly
making his adieus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come back again!” said he. “We’ll be waiting for
you next year. Tell every ranch in Texas to send up
their herds. You’ll see Abilene with a jail and a church
and a school and a graveyard the next time you come.
I have been so busy——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Came among the very last a woman of the Silver
Moon, young in years but weary and old at this hour of
the morning. Timidly she reached out her hand through
the curtains of the ambulance and Taisie took it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-by,” said the girl; “good-by, my dear. You’re
the first woman ever came to Abilene. Don’t come
back again,”—and so departed to the Silver Moon,
herself once a woman, and seeing Taisie’s eyes following
the tall young man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pattison, the Northern stockman, spent some time in
final conversation with Mr. Dan McMasters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Believe me, son,” said he, with a final farewell,
“when you marry and settle down with me up here I’ll
make you richer than you ever dreamed of being. Go
back home and put up a herd of stockers for next
spring. Tell the Texas drovers to come along. There’s
going to be money in cows now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McMasters reached out and took his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be back next season with a herd,” said he. “So
long!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among all these others also came Wild Bill Hickok,
future town marshal of Abilene. By odd chance, partly
due to his own shyness, he had never in all these days
met Taisie Lockhart. He did not mean to intrude now,
but inadvertently peered in at the curtains of her ambulance.
She saw him push back the curtain, reached out
her hand, smiling. He took it, held it, stood awed at her
very beauty, pondering for a time sadly, her hand in
his, in one of the fits of melancholy which came to him
at times. As he knew his life of the past, so he read
all his future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You remind me of Agnes,” said he simply. “That’s
my wife. She’s back home. Be good. Good-by.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With McMasters he spoke at first hardly so much
even as that. They shook hands, each looking into
the eyes of the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good luck!” said Hickok. “Don’t say I didn’t help
you with the habeas corpus. If you run into any one
down below kill this man first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded at Rudabaugh. The latter broke out
blasphemously once more. But the blue eye of the man
who had killed the last of the Rudabaugh gang of
border thieves paid him not even a contemptuous attention.
He turned away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now came the parting crack of a whip on the air of
the morning, rumble of wheels on the streets of Abilene,
already growing dustier. Abilene, center of revolutionary
changes soon to be, lay behind them presently.
The Del Sol folk were homeward bound.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>On the long journey to the South, after the first
hour, the leading ambulance vehicle never again was
sighted. From day to day, from camp to camp, at one
river crossing after another, the slower travelers found
proof of attempts to make their progress as safe and
easy as possible. There were rafts and boats, each
left on the north bank of the stream. Fords were
marked out with poles. What with the passing of Jesse
Chisholm’s wagon trail to the Arbuckle Mountains, and
the additional care of McMasters and the Army men,
the passage southward, thus well equipped, was child’s
play compared with the long and dangerous journey
northbound with the herd. The lead ambulance easily
did forty and fifty miles a day, the ox carts twelve,
fifteen, sometimes twenty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again and again Taisie Lockhart felt growing upon
her her sense of indebtedness to a man with whom she
could never come to terms. One thing seemed certain—they
now had parted company forever. He was
leaving Texas, going North to live. Bitterly the girl
resolved that all material obligations between them, at
least, should one day be discharged, though it should
take her last dollar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not once on all the long journey did McMasters ever
accost his prisoner. Cold as a tourmaline, his green-gray
eyes looked Rudabaugh straight in the face when
occasion came. But that was all. At night the prisoner
had chance to sleep, no chance to escape. If McMasters
himself caught a continuous hour or two of sleep, the
boy Cinquo took his place, his weapon across his knee.
Men fed Rudabaugh with no more ceremony than had
he been a captive animal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, on one morning, two days’ march south of the
Washita, McMasters and his men raised the rough
highlands of Medicine Bluff Creek, where sat Camp
Wichita which not long thereafter was to be known as
Fort Sill, thanks to the earlier and long-forgotten
efforts of that great soldier of the West, R. B. Marcy,
captain of the Fifth Infantry; the first explorer for the
Army in those parts, and a wise man in Indian matters
in his day. He had predicted the savage campaign of
two years later, of Sheridan, Custer, which proved
needful to chastise the upper tribesmen, of Black Kettle,
on the Washita.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to the reservation which later was to hold the
Comanches, subsequent to the series of tribal defeats
wrought by Custer along the Washita, nothing was
consummated until the following year. The main body
of the Quahrada Comanches—those who had the Staked
Plains as their hunting grounds—had traveled on back
home. But here in the Wichita Mountains sturdy
Sandy Griswold still held old Yellow Hand and his
select band of warriors, waiting for word from north
of the Arkansas. He had told Yellow Hand to wait
until his young men came. Then they could go back
home. And Yellow Hand himself was the first to
announce the coming of men from the north.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The welcome between McMasters and Griswold was
brief. The latter looked inside the ambulance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve got your man!” said he grimly. “How
about the others?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They resisted arrest, sir,” replied Dan McMasters.
“I had the help of Wild Bill Hickok at Abilene. I have
kept my word and brought in Rudabaugh for you.
Here’s your man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get out, you!” He spoke to Rudabaugh the first
time, and cut his bands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prisoner climbed stiffly down and looked about
him. He faced a row of Army tents, a few rough
huts. A clump of Indian tepees stood not far distant.
A strong shudder came across the body of Sim Rudabaugh.
His face went white in sudden premonition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Comanches were waiting for the man who had
killed their women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my God!” moaned the prisoner, now really
contrite. “Oh, my God, have mercy!” Even then
he knew.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Griswold called for his interpreter, ordered the
Comanches to come before his tent. They sat in council,
the pipe passed. The beady eyes of the Comanches
were fixed on the prisoner, but they sat in silent dignity
until the proper time. At length Griswold arose,
addressing Yellow Hand and pointing to Rudabaugh,
whom he kept standing, his hands again bound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell him,” said Griswold, nodding to his interpreter,
and speaking to Yellow Hand, “this is the man who shot
down your women when they were bathing over there
by the Arbuckle Hills. You Quahradas, of the Staked
Plains, were visiting here. You had not harmed this
man. He was not at war with you. You had not
harmed him. He killed your women. He did not
seek out your warriors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I said to you that I would bring this man back to
you for you to try. You can punish him as you like.
I give him to you. You do not know this man. You
only know that the men who wear a yellow stripe on
their leggings never have lied to you. This is the man
who killed your women. I say it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He raised his hand as Yellow Hand started forward,
his face convulsed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I have your promise also, Yellow Hand.
You shall not lie to me. When I give him to you in
place of your two women you must do as you have
promised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you now go back to your people and tell them
to sit down? Will you tell them to leave the war trail
on the Staked Plains, to leave our white towns and
ranches alone, and the cattle they drive north?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you come here, all of you, and join the northern
Comanches and your brothers the Kiowas and
sit down forever, here on your land, where the buffalo
are many and the deer are running in the thickets as
many as the leaves on the trees? Here the sun is
warm, the grass is good, the water is sweet and cool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you do all these things, Yellow Hand? Are
you done fighting with the white man? I promise
you that next year, and the year after, the white
soldiers will take the winter trail against the villages of
the Cheyennes and their friends. No matter how cold
it is, no matter how deep the snow is, our men will find
their village and wipe them out. You Indians must stop
stealing horses and cattle and killing our men on the
ranches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you Quahradas, who are wise men, make your
peace first and save your women and your children? If
I give you this man will you open the trails for the
cows that want to go north? Will you come in here
and sit down? Promise me that, Yellow Hand!
Speak only the truth to me! I know how to punish
men who lie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The face of the old savage still worked with rage;
his eyes still were riveted on the miscreant who stood
bound before him, tragic pledge for the future safety
of the Trail. But now Yellow Hand knew himself
to be the leader of his people. He rose with his
arms folded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I speak the truth, now, here, even as the chief of the
white men speaks it,” said he. “You have done as you
have said you would do. Give us that man that you
said you would give us. We will do with him as
your people would do with us. We will try him in
our way. I will talk with my men. We will punish
him in our way. Then when we have done that we
will wrap our robes about us. We will come in here
and sit down in this land, which we know is good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can see that the white people are too many.
They are making roads across the grass. Some day the
buffalo will be gone. Over their trails will walk these
new cattle—have we not seen them come? I can hear
their hoofs coming, as many as the wind can count
among the trees. It is done. I have said all I want
to say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rudabaugh,” said Griswold, turning to him at
length, with no pity in his eye, “get ready to die. God
may have no mercy on your soul. You’ve shown none—not
once in all your life. Take what you’ve earned!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rudabaugh broke out with denunciation of the utter
illegality of all this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it,” said Griswold. “But this court carries
no records. No one will ever know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pushed forward the man, who now so trembled
he scarce could stand. The sinewy fingers of Yellow
Hand gripped his shoulder like eagle talons. A warrior
caught him on the opposite side. He was dragged
away, fighting, to the door of the largest lodge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For an hour there came through the distance only
the sound of savage singing. At length the white
men, sitting solemnly awake in their own encampment,
saw a group of the Comanches come out from the lodge
and start toward a little thicket which lay perhaps a
hundred yards or so away. They dragged with them
something which scarce stood erect, held back with
palsied feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My God, Mister Dan,” broke out the voice of a
boy all too young for such a scene, but taking one
more lesson in border ways, “what are they goin’ to
do to him now?”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>But the savage justice of the tribesmen was done in
such fashion as only these fiends of the lower border
could have devised. No pen should specify as to this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a time, for five minutes perhaps, or more, there
came from the thicket shrieks of a man in torture,
such sounds as left these hardened men unable to look
one another in the face, though not one of them
wavered in his own savage decision. Now it was
too late. The word of the white men had been given.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No smoke, no sign of fire arose above the top of the
little thicket. There was no sound but that of the
shrieking victim. The Comanches had devised some
new way of punishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yellow Hand came back after a long time, a smile
contorting his great mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Him run little way,” said he, wiping his hands on
his leggings. “No skin on him—he can’t run far.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And for reason of that which had gone on in yonder
thicket by the little stream—by reason of what one
time was found flung across the bush tops there—that
bloody stream came to be called the Rawhide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Comanche reservation, thus purchased, later
established, was close to that spot. Far to the west,
above Doan’s Crossing, over the high country where
soon a dozen trails were to blend—seeking Ellsworth,
Newton, Wichita, Dodge, Great Bend, Ogalalla, all
the Army posts and all the empty upper range—the
Comanches fought no more.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The day of the northbound hegira of the cows had
come. The immortal gods, trickling through their
fingers grasses of grama, mesquite, redtop, buffalo,
bluestem, watched a new land spring lustily into being.
It was born of blood. But it was born of South and
North, which never again were to know war one with
the other. Both shared in sending old customs to a
new land. A new language came to it. New industries
grew in it. More rapidly than any tract of all our
country or of any country ever was settled, the Great
West of America became great and strong indeed. It
wrote its story—whose beginnings almost have faded
now—on the pages of the world’s history; or more
splendidly still, on the lips of a country’s envying
tradition of Homeric deeds.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='417' id='Page_417'></span><h1>CHAPTER XLVIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE GREAT LODESTONE</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>I</span></span>T WAS morning of an autumn day on the old
rancho of Laguna de Sol. Although flowers
lacked, the leaves of the live oaks held their
perennial course unchanged, the heavy pendants of the
Spanish moss aiding them against the rays of a sun
still ardent. The air was almost without movement,
too richly languorous for any exercise—sweet, rich,
mellow and golden as honey, breath of a world caring
for neither past nor future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The surface of the placid fields where grain had been
now seemed as though covered by a moving carpet of
gray and gold—countless field larks, come to this gentle
region for their wintering. In the great lagoon beyond
the live-oak groves countless wild fowl, also from north
of thirty-six, had come below the edge of winter for
their annual vacation. The cattle lay contented in the
sun, horses stood dozing, free of care. Del Sol never
had seemed more beautiful or shown more rapport
with the mere facts of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anastasie Lockhart, mistress of Del Sol, was in her
dooryard, looking after morning-glory seed for the
coming year. These and other climbing things had
well-nigh taken possession of the big house during
her absence north the past summer. There had been
no hand to give the old place any ministrations, and
in the fecund Southwest the fight of civilization
against an eager Nature, claiming its own, is a continuous
one. Years of poverty, which had meant also
years of negligence, now obliged youth and inexperience
to begin in a weak way the task of restoration.
Del Sol had lacked the strong and resourceful hand
of its founder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not that courage and resourcefulness lacked for the
present owner of Del Sol—nor, indeed, that material
means now lacked, after the astonishingly successful
venture of the northern drive. And the steady ruin
into which the place had advanced had been due more
than anything else to an actual lack of material
resources.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anastasie Lockhart had been poor. But now she
was not poor. The venture north had brought her in
touch with the Aladdin lamp. Now she could hold up
her head and look all the world in the face. Now she
could pay her debts and be once more a Lockhart of
the Lockharts, worthy when on her knees to look her
departed father’s shade calmly in the face and to declare
his faith kept with all the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This very morning Anastasie Lockhart had paid
her men their wages for the month; indeed, but just
now she had come from the cook-house door; where
not so long before she had stood, haltingly confessing
to them that she could not pay her laborers their
hire. It was different to-day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not all the old Del Sol men now were at their
table, for some had taken service north, perhaps never
again to set foot on Texas soil, and others had not
yet drifted home from seeing the world. Buck, the
cook, still was there; and it appeared that both he
and Milly had agreed to forget the past of Milly’s
missing husband. Milly agreeing that she had “taken
up with Buck,” believing him to be the moral superior
of the missing Jim. The place of Del Williams was
vacant, nor was Len Hersey’s light garrulity now
audible. No heirs of Cal Dalhart had been found.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were new men on Del Sol, new horses and
new cows. Old Jim Nabours, when he swung into
saddle that morning, had at his side only one man of
the old Del Sol clan—the boy Cinquo Centavos, now
resplendent in the full regalia of the range and much
more the man for his adventurings in far lands. Both
these had stood at Blancocito’s head to assist their
mistress in mounting when she rode back to the big
house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So now Taisie Lockhart was pretty much alone as
she pottered about the galleries of the old house, searching
for morning-glory seeds, putting them into her
cupped left hand. She was in riding habit now, her
male attire discarded, and a sidesaddle fretted Blancocito;
not the old saddle of low horn and double
cinch, which he had yielded only after a long and bitter
fight against the new substitute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What a change since that other morning of the
spring, half a year ago, when she had returned from
the cook-house door! Could this unsmiling young
lady, tall and dignified, well clad, be the same Taisie
Lockhart of that other day? On which day had she
been rich, on which day poor? A world intervened
between the two. Anastasie Lockhart, a new little
droop at the corner of her mouth, knew that were
it possible she would give this day for that other—that
day when she was poor. That was when first
she saw a tall young man ride in at her gate, whom
she had never seen again since their cold parting in the
street of Abilene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some thought, some sound unrecognized, something
in the air—she knew not what—caused Taisie’s
cupped hand to cease accumulating morning-glory
seeds, the fingers of the other to halt arrested in the
air. She turned. That same rider now was entering
her gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The face of the mistress of Del Sol went pale. She
dropped her morning-glory seeds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rider, tall, slender, very straight, very easy in
saddle, came on in directly through the gate, which
a darky boy had opened for him. But he did not this
morning, as upon that other morning, ride to the
cook-house yard. Upon the contrary, at the same
steady gentle and unbroken trot, he rode up, unfaltering,
unagitated, to the gallery of Del Sol. His hat in hand,
he dismounted not a dozen paces from where stood
Anastasie, dumb and motionless, pale, even in the
Texan sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He also, for the time, was dumb. He came straight
up to her without speaking. She noticed certain things,
intimately shrewd, her memory holding every detail
of the man whom for months she had known she loved
in spite of every endeavor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was scrupulously neat, now, as he had always
been. His clothing was new and good. His collar and
his cuffs were white—pure white, in good linen. Once—she
vaguely remembered it now—he had not worn
white; had explained to her some reason for the dull
red of his linen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And there was another change, she was sure of
this—he was unarmed! The heavy weapons no longer
swung at his belt, nor even showed in his saddle
holsters. For the first time since she had known him
she saw him weaponless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He seemed another man, for some reason, she could
not tell what. The same imperturbable calm, the same
level gaze of the eye, the same inscrutable mask of
countenance were his, and still he seemed to retain his
habit of casting the burden of speech upon others than
himself; but there was about him something different.
Sometimes we feel some such indefinable change in a
man who has suffered a great sickness or met with
some great reverse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you good morning, Mr. McMasters,” said
Anastasie, half irritated at the length of his silence,
though never had his eyes wavered from her face. He
had wanted to speak, but his lifelong reticence glued
his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made no immediate reply, disdainful as usual
of the irrelevant, the inconsequent. At length he drew
from his inner pocket a folded bit of paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have come to bring you this, Miss Lockhart,”
said he, and gave it her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at it, recognized it, and colored deeply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was my wish that you should have it,” said
she.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I cannot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why not? It is only right and fair that I
should pay my debts, the same as any other person.
My father paid his. I sent you the draft as I was
bound to do. I wanted to pay you—especially wanted
to pay you.” Her color heightened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why? To square my obligations to you. They
were enough. If I had known before I started what
a load of debt you had put on me, there would never
have been a Del Sol cow driven north. I’d have died,
starved, rather than have been under any such obligation
to you! I’d have choked if I’d known I was eating
your bread!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you think you have paid all your debt now
with this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She twisted the paper of the bank draft in her
fingers, unconsciously dropped it on the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said she, honest always; “there are some
things that one can’t pay. There are some things
that can’t be paid. But I sent you the draft, guessing
at the total because I could never get a statement
from the men fairly covering the advances you made
us without my knowledge. We did eat your bread.
Without you and your supplies—your horses, your
everything—without your care and help all the way
over the trail, we couldn’t have started and couldn’t
have got through. Ah”—bitterly—“we couldn’t even
have sold so well at the end of the trail. That’s all
true. It’s the cruelest truth that ever was offered me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You didn’t want to be helped, not even by your
neighbor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not in that way; not after all—after everything—after
some things had come out as they did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean, after your own fault had found you
out, don’t you? Isn’t that the cruelest part of it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His words were merciless, yet his voice was kind,
gentle, beyond compare with any voice she had heard
in all her life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes!” she broke out. “Yes, I suppose that’s true.
But you have had no mercy; you show none now.
Did you come here this morning to make me say
that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Dan McMasters; “that is why I did
come. I knew that sometime you’d want to tell me
that. I knew that before I went away from you,
you’d want to be Lockhart enough to admit to a
McMasters that no McMasters ever born could be the
dishonorable man you thought I was. You sent me
out of your camp with a brand on me that I never
would have taken if I hadn’t loved you the first minute
I saw you—and if I hadn’t known that some day you’d
want to tell me you were wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anastasie Lockhart spread out her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haven’t I? I have repented it every night and
every day since then. But of what use? You are not
one who can forgive. You only want to shame and
humiliate me, you can’t forgive. You wouldn’t let
me, wouldn’t believe me, wouldn’t forgive me. You
say you can’t change.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you so sure?” His voice spoke as though in
answer to some question of his own. “Which of us
can be sure of anything? Who knows about these
things?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pulled himself together, trying not to let his emotions
go, to hold to safe things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think my father or yours would let us be
anything but neighbors?” he began. “Did not those
two gentlemen fight all their lives together, for their
principles, for their state? They were friends, even
after the war, even in the war. If you had a brother,
do you suppose my sister could make any payment to
him for things like this? Those men were Texans.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You did nothing for me, then,” said Anastasie
Lockhart, trying to be furious. “You did not think
of me; you thought of Texas. You thought of everything
but me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anastasie,” said he quietly, “that isn’t right. I
have thought of nothing else but you since I met you.
Love—why, you can’t measure what love will do!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Love, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But now his words rushed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neighbor and neighbor—yes. Gonzales and Caldwell—yes.
Lockhart and McMasters—yes. The big
trail opening up, the whole country opening up—yes.
The Indians giving way before the white men—yes.
A new day coming into all this country—why yes! I
can see all those things, and so can you. But why?
What actuated it all? It seems to me it must have
been love—love of man and woman. I know it was
my love for you that drove me. There are things we
can’t ever measure. I couldn’t explain what I mean—no.
And, of course I know,” he added, “I’d have no
right to if I could.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anastasie Lockhart stood looking at him, wide-eyed.
Surely—she knew it now with a sudden gasp of apprehension—her
instinct had been right. She had loved
in him something other than the cold dominancy of
his nature. Now she knew that he was not the coldest
man in all the world, but a man of tempestuous heats,
with storm and stress about him. For the first time
she saw his fingers tremble as he half reached out a
hand, withdrew it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Neither could he now speak, except with effort. It
seemed that, after all, they were come to the parting
of the roads.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you wanted my signature to come back to you
under the words ‘In full to date.’ Is it in full to
date? Well, we’ll part the better friends for my
having come here. And you thought I could not
forgive!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes!” the girl broke out at last. “I thought you
were the hardest, coldest, cruelest man in all the world.
I have seen only the savage side of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His face changed, grew suddenly sad; upon it came
the melancholy occasionally so notable on the face of
another man of like trade, whom he had met not long
before in the North.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think you can quite understand everything
in the world all at once, my dear,” said he. “I was
set apart from men, because I had taken on work to
do. Home and the love of woman could not be for
me. I was nothing more than a priest—high priest
of law and justice. My hands had to be red. I knew
I could never come to you feeling that it was right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His face was gray, he undertook to smile, bitterly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was a killer!” he exclaimed. “I became that out
of duty to my family and my state. I knew what it
meant—knew well enough. I couldn’t offer you a hand
red as mine. I thought a time surely would come
when you’d have a horror come over you, thinking of
what I’d done. But I had to go on with my work until
it was done. I studied it. I shot away a thousand
pounds of lead, I used kegs of powder, in practice.
And I studied concentration. That was the only way
I could be safe. Of course, I can’t make you understand
that. But I was playing in a game where I did
not dare lose. My life was up all the time and more
than my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now he was turning away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are going?” said she.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. The last of the open gang of thieves and
outlaws is dead to-day. The roads are open. The
state can breathe. The great conspiracy is ended.
We’ve done our work. For those who are to benefit
by it, what difference if we do pass unknown and
forgotten? Your father’s murderer is dead. We did
what we had to do. That was what I did—I did
that first, before I dared to think of beginning my own
life for myself. But——” And now he drew himself
up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She knew that he wanted to indicate to her something.
Her eyes rested on the whiteness of his linen.
He saw the look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said he, looking at his hands, “I’ve turned
over a leaf. I have thrown away my guns. Never
while I live will I put them on again, either here or in
the North. I am no longer a hired killer. From
where the sun stands now I am done with that. I am
McMasters, citizen, not officer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had found his bridle reins, but did not go, could
not go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were talking about forgiveness,” said he, at
length, with difficulty. “Forgive you? Why, I have
never done anything but that! Of course, since I am
going away, I ought to forget you; but I never shall.
All you have to do about me is to forget me. There
are better men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl flared out at him with some sudden impulse
which got beyond her control.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You come here to preach to me? Is that the way
to do? Oh, you ride into my place and you make me
tear out my heart with shame and humiliation and show
it to you. And then you ride away again and say
good-by and tell me to forget! Why did you come here
at all? Couldn’t you have mailed back my draft?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hesitated. His hand dropped to his side. Suddenly
he held out to her a little object which so, by
accident, he had touched; something which had been in
the side pocket of his coat. In appearance it was a
fragment of dark red rock, broken irregularly. But
Taisie’s eyes noticed that to it clung another object—a
horse-shoe steel, such as the riders of the outlands were
used to carry with a bit of flint so they might be
safe for fire in any exigency. Without plan, these two
objects now served Dan McMasters for the thing which
he had not been able to put into speech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anastasie,” said he, “look at this! It’s nothing—only
a bit of ore I picked up near the Wichitas when I
came through. But see, it’s magnetic. Look how steel
clings to it! You hardly can draw them apart; it will
pull to it every little piece of metal. It can’t help itself;
they can’t help themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Taisie, what’s inside of it? I don’t know. What is
that force that we can’t see? I don’t know. I don’t
know anything. You ask me questions that I can’t
answer. All I know is that the magnet and the steel
come together—here, you see. And yet you ask me
why am I here now? I don’t know. It’s the same
reason that made me leave Rudabaugh alive in his
camp and ride after you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t I tell you there are things we can’t weigh
or measure? There’s something behind the world
we can’t any of us find out! Why did I come? I
don’t know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tossed the little bit of rock and the clinging
steel upon the ground beside the twisted fragment of
Anastasie Lockhart’s draft, “In full to date.” His
eyes were softened. The lines of chin and jaw seemed
new to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have been trying to reason things out,” said he
at last, in a new, strange, shaken voice she never yet
had heard. “I am trying now to reason out why I
don’t get on up and ride on away. We’ve said good-by.
I’ve reasoned that you couldn’t love me. Am I right
or wrong?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anastasie Lockhart slowly raised her face, her
serious, grave eyes looking straight into his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were wrong!” said she. “You have used
me like a man. I was a woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stepped toward her, in the open sunlight where
any might have seen, caught her face between his two
hands and looked into her eyes with his own new eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t mean we could both begin again?
You don’t mean you could forget what I have been?
You don’t mean I could ever be good enough for you?
You don’t mean you could ever learn to love me in
spite of what I was, for sake of what I am going to try
to be? Tell me—answer me now, for I don’t think
I can endure this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His two hands had fallen on her shoulders, straightened
her up, held her at arm’s length for just an instant.
The innate bravery of the girl aided her to look straight
into his eyes in turn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know,” she said, smiling slowly. “You must
know now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tension of the fingers on her shoulders lessened.
His voice came almost in a whisper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do know! Why, there is a new world, after all!
We are the very first. There is no past.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dan!” said she, after a long time. “Dan!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her fingers were twisting softly around his wrist,
crumpling the white linen that they found there. Her
eyes followed her fingers, not daring to look up. Her
fingers were warm. He caught her chin in both his
hands, though still her fingers clung.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Taisie,” said he, “what fools we’ve been! Ah,
what a blind fool I was! Forgive me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Dan!” she murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her head fell forward upon his shoulder, drowsily,
although it was morning, and though the sun shone all
around them, brilliantly, blindingly.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
